Hikitia|"Hikitia is a working self-propelled floating steam crane in Wellington New Zealand. She is thought to be the only working steam crane of her type in the world. She is also the sister ship to the Rapaki formerly of the Port of Lyttelton which is now at the New Zealand Maritime Museum.

Twin screws are driven by surface-condensing direct-drive compound engines which were supplied with steam by a coal-fired Scotch boiler with two furnaces. A similar but oil-fired boiler replaced the original boiler in 1963. In 1980 this was also removed and the present two locally made small modern package boilers were installed. These new boilers produce less steam than the original ones.

Walleye|The walleye  (Sander vitreus synonym Stizostedion vitreum) also called the yellow pike or  yellow pickerel is a freshwater perciform fish native to most of Canada and to the Northern United States. It is a North American close relative of the European zander also known as the pikeperch. The walleye is sometimes called the yellow walleye to distinguish it from the blue walleye which is a subspecies that was once found in the southern Ontario and Quebec regions but is now presumed extinct. However recent genetic analysis of a preserved (frozen) 'blue walleye' sample suggests that the blue and yellow walleye were simply phenotypes within the same species and do not merit separate taxonomic classification.In parts of its range in English-speaking Canada the walleye is known as a pickerel  though the fish is not related to the true pickerels which are a member of the family Esocidae.Walleyes show a fair amount of variation across watersheds. In general fish within a watershed are...|0

Battle_of_Hamath|"The Battle of Hamath sometimes called the Battle of Hama was a battle between the Babylonians and the fleeing remnants of the Egyptian army defeated at Carchemish. It was fought near the ancient city Hamath on the Orontes.
In this battle Nebuchadrezzar further shattered the remnants of Necho II's Egyptian army that he had previously defeated in the Battle of Carchemish. The battle is mentioned in the Babylonian Chronicles now housed in the British Museum. In the Chronicles it states that Nebuchadrezzar II killed almost all of the Egyptian combatants so exhausted that none of them returned to their own country.

It was a prolonged naval operation conducted by the Triple-Entente powers  during and after World War I in an effort to restrict the maritime supply of goods to the Central Powers which included Germany Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. It is considered one of the key elements in the eventual Allied victory in the war.  The German Board of Public Health in December 1918 claimed that 763000 German civilians died from starvation and disease caused by the blockade up until the end of December 1918. An academic study done in 1928 put the death toll at 424000. An additional 100000 people may have died during the continuation blockade in 1919.Both Germany and the United Kingdom relied heavily on imports to feed their population and supply their war industry.  Imports of foodstuffs and war materiel of European belligerents came primarily from the Americas and had to be shipped across the Atlantic Ocean...|1

Gadiformes|"Gadiformes are an order of ray-finned fish also called the Anacanthini that includes the cod and its allies. Many major food fish are in this order. They are found in marine waters throughout the world and the vast majority of the species are found in temperate or colder regions (tropical species are typically deep-water). A few species may enter estuaries but only one the burbot (Lota lota) is a freshwater fish.
Common characteristics include the positioning of the pelvic fins (if present) below or in front of the pectoral fins. Gadiformes are physoclists which means their gas bladders do not have a pneumatic duct. The fins are spineless. Gadiform fish range in size from the codlets which may be as small as 7 cm (2.8 in) in adult length to the Atlantic cod Gadus morhua which reaches up to 2 m (6.6 ft).

Herbivore|"A herbivore is an animal anatomically and physiologically adapted to eating plant material for example foliage or marine algae for the main component of its diet. As a result of their plant diet herbivorous animals typically have mouthparts adapted to rasping or grinding. Horses and other herbivores have wide flat teeth that are adapted to grinding grass tree bark and other tough plant material.
A large percentage of herbivores have mutualistic gut flora that help them digest plant matter which is more difficult to digest than animal prey. This flora is made up of cellulose-digesting protozoans or bacteria.


== Etymology ==
Herbivore is the anglicized form of a modern Latin coinage herbivora cited in Charles Lyell's 1830 Principles of Geology. Richard Owen employed the anglicized term in an 1854 work on fossil teeth and skeletons.   Herbivora is derived from the Latin herba meaning a small plant or herb and vora from vorare to eat or devour.

Lobengula reportedly could muster 80000 spearmen and 20000 riflemen armed with Martini-Henry rifles which were modern arms at that time. However poor training meant that these were not used effectively.

Falcon|"Falcons () are birds of prey in the genus Falco which includes about 40 species. Falcons are widely distributed on all continents of the world except Antarctica though closely related raptors did occur there in the Eocene.Adult falcons have thin tapered wings which enable them to fly at high speed and change direction rapidly. Fledgling falcons in their first year of flying have longer flight feathers which make their configuration more like that of a general-purpose bird such as a broad-wing. This makes flying easier while learning the exceptional skills required to be effective hunters as adults.
The falcons are the largest genus in the Falconinae subfamily of Falconidae which itself also includes another subfamily comprising caracaras and a few other species. All these birds kill with their beaks using a ""tooth"" on the side of their beaks—unlike the hawks eagles and other birds of prey in the Accipitridae which use their feet.

Spotty_(fish)|"The spotty Notolabrus celidotus is a species of wrasse endemic to the waters around New Zealand including Stewart Island.  It can be found on reefs at depths from 22 to 145 m (72 to 476 ft) though most common in shallower parts of that range.  This species can reach 23.9 cm (9.4 in) in standard length. Like other wrasses spotties begin life as females. Once they reach a length of 13–19 cm at the age of 3–4 years some of the largest fish may turn into males. Male spotties stake out territories in which they maintain a harem of roughly 20 females that they aggressively defend from other males. When a male dies the dominant female in the harem will change sex over a few days and take over control of both the harem and territory. This social structure keeps the sex ratio strongly biased towards females. Spawning usually occurs from late July to the end of October.

Cusk_(fish)|"The cusk or tusk (Brosme brosme) is a North Atlantic cod-like fish in the ling family Lotidae. It is the only species in the genus Brosme. Other common names include Tusk Torsk European Cusk Brosmius.


== Description ==
It is easily distinguished at a glance from other cod-like fish as it has only one dorsal fin.  Also characteristic is the nature of the dorsal caudal and anal fins they are continuous at the base but separated by very deep notches so that they are obviously distinct.  Moreover the caudal fin is evenly rounded.  It is variable in color from slate to reddish brown above and paling to gray on the lower sides and underneath.  Older fish are usually plain colored while the young often have transverse yellow bands on the sides.  The maximum length is about 4 ft (120 cm) and top weight about 45 lb (20 kg). The IGFA world record stands at 37 lb 14 oz (1720 kg) caught by Anders Jonasson outside Sørøya in northern Norway.

The non-pollinators belong to several groups within the superfamily Chalcidoidea while the pollinators are in the family Agaonidae. While pollinating fig wasps are gall-makers the remaining types either make their own galls or usurp the galls of other fig wasps; reports of them being parasitoids are considered dubious.

Aristotle recorded in his History of Animals that the fruits of the wild fig (the caprifig) contain psenes (fig wasps); these begin life as grubs (larvae) and the adult psen splits its ""skin"" (pupa) and flies out of the fig to find and enter a cultivated fig saving it from dropping.

American black bears are omnivores with their diets varying greatly depending on season and location. They typically live in largely forested areas but will leave forests in search of food. They are sometimes attracted to human communities because of the immediate availability of food. The American black bear is the world's most common bear species. The fur though usually black is not always this color.  Some subspecies do not show as black.
It is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a least-concern species due to its widespread distribution and a large population estimated to be twice that of all other bear species combined. Along with the brown bear it is one of only two of the eight modern bear species not considered by the IUCN to be globally threatened with extinction.

Larva|"A larva  (plural larva ) is a distinct juvenile form many  animals undergo before metamorphosis into adults. Animals with indirect development such as insects amphibians or cnidarians typically have a larva phase of their life cycle.
The larva's appearance is generally very different from the adult form (e.g. caterpillars and butterflies) including different unique structures and organs that do not occur in the adult form. Their diet may also be considerably different.
Larvae are frequently adapted to environments separate from adults. For example some larvae such as tadpoles live almost exclusively in aquatic environments but can live outside water as adult frogs. By living in a distinct environment larvae may be given shelter from predators and reduce competition for resources with the adult population.
Animals in the larval stage will consume food to fuel their transition into the adult form. In some organisms like polychaetes and barnacles adults are immobile but their larvae..."|0

Luth_Enchantee|"Luth Enchantee (foaled 1980) was a French Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare who was named the best horse in Europe over one mile in 1983. Her early career was undistinguished as she won one minor event in her first eight races. In the summer of her three-year-old season she made rapid improvement winning the Prix d'Astarte against her own sex and then defeating male opposition to win France's two most important all-aged mile races the Prix Jacques Le Marois and the Prix du Moulin. In autumn she was moved up in distance and finished a close third to All Along in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

Great_Retreat_(Russian)|"The Great Retreat was a strategic withdrawal on the Eastern Front of World War I in 1915. The Imperial Russian Army gave up the salient in Galicia and Poland. The Russians' critically under-equipped and (at the points of engagement) outnumbered forces suffered great losses in the Central Powers' July–September summer offensive operations this leading to the Stavka ordering a withdrawal to shorten the front lines and avoid the potential encirclement of large Russian forces in the salient. While the withdrawal itself was relatively well conducted it was a severe blow to Russian morale.

During this period the buildup of forces generally favoured the Central Powers. Four new German armies the 11th 12th Army of the Niemen and Army of the Bug were formed.

Amblycera|"The Amblycera are a large suborder of chewing lice parasitic on both birds and mammals. The Amblycera are considered the most primitive suborder of lice.


== Description ==
These insects are very much like the familiar advanced sucking lice except they do not stay on their host permanently. They roam freely over the surface of their host and unlike other lice do not form permanent attachments. They feed by chewing soft areas of skin causing an area of localized bleeding from which they drink.
Species of this suborder have antennae but they cannot readily be seen because they lie in grooves in the side of the head.  Usually the antennae of suborder Amblycera composes 4-5 segments.  The maxillary palps may however be present and these may be visible in mounted specimens but may be confused with the antennae.  Palps of amblycerans ranges in segments from two to five. The mandibles of this suborder bite horizontally. The head is often broader and rounder anteriorly than of Anoplura but..."|0
Mantophasmatidae|"Mantophasmatidae  is a family of carnivorous wingless insects within the order Notoptera which was discovered in Africa in 2001. Originally the group was regarded as an order in its own right and named Mantophasmatodea but using recent evidence indicating a sister group relationship with Grylloblattidae (formerly classified in the order Grylloblattodea) Arillo and Engel have combined the two groups into a single order Notoptera.


== Overview ==
The most common vernacular name for this order is gladiators although they also are called rock crawlers heelwalkers mantophasmids and colloquially mantos. Their modern centre of endemism is western South Africa and Namibia (Brandberg Massif) although a relict population and Eocene fossils suggest a wider ancient distribution.

Caenorhabditis_elegans|"Caenorhabditis elegans () is a free-living transparent nematode about 1 mm in length that lives in temperate soil environments. It is the type species of its genus. The name is a blend of the Greek caeno- (recent) rhabditis (rod-like) and Latin elegans (elegant). In 1900 Maupas initially named it Rhabditides elegans. Osche placed it in the subgenus Caenorhabditis in 1952 and in 1955 Dougherty raised Caenorhabditis to the status of genus.C. elegans is an unsegmented pseudocoelomate and lacks respiratory or circulatory systems. Most of these nematodes are hermaphrodites and a few are males. Males have specialised tails for mating that include spicules.
In 1963 Sydney Brenner proposed research into C. elegans primarily in the area of neuronal development. In 1974 he began research into the molecular and developmental biology of C. elegans which has since been extensively used as a model organism.

Various species occur in regions throughout Africa Southwest Asia South Asia and Southeast Asia. Several other elapid species are also called ""cobras"" such as the king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) and the rinkhals (Hemachatus haemachatus) but neither are true cobras. They are not true cobras in that they do not belong to the genus Naja but instead each belong to monotypic genera Hemachatus (the rinkhals) and Ophiophagus (the king cobra/hamadryad).Until recently the genus Naja had 20 to 22 species but it has undergone several taxonomic revisions in recent years so sources vary greatly.

Ischnocera|"The Ischnocera is a large suborder of lice mostly parasitic on birds but including a large family (the Trichodectidae) parasitic on mammals. The genus  Trichophilopterus is also found on mammals (lemurs) but probably belongs to the ""avian Ischnocera"" and represents a host switch from birds to mammals. It is a chewing louse which feeds on the feathers and skin debris of birds. Many of the avian Ischnocera have evolved an elongated body shape. This allows them to conceal themselves between the feather shafts and avoid being dislodged during preening or flight.
The taxonomy of the group is in need of revision. Currently four families are recognised but one of these the Philopteridae is almost certainly paraphyletic. The families are:

Heptapsogasteridae
Goniodidae
Philopteridae

Anglerfish|"The anglerfish are fish of the teleost order Lophiiformes (). They are bony fish named for its characteristic mode of predation in which a modified fin ray (the esca or illicium) acts as a lure for other fish. 
Some anglerfish are notable for extreme sexual dimorphism and sexual symbiosis of the small male with the much larger female seen in the suborder Ceratioidei the deep sea anglerfish. In these species males may be several orders of magnitude smaller than females.Anglerfish occur worldwide. Some are pelagic (dwelling away from the sea floor) while others are benthic (dwelling close to the sea floor). Some live in the deep sea (such as the Ceratiidae) while others on the continental shelf such as the frogfishes and the Lophiidaemonkfish or goosefish). Pelagic forms are most laterally compressed whereas the benthic forms are often extremely dorsoventrally compressed (depressed) often with large upward-pointing mouths.

Battle_of_Cochin_(1504)|"The Battle of Cochin sometimes referred as the Second Siege of Cochin was a series of confrontations between March and July 1504 fought on land and sea principally between the Portuguese garrison at Cochin allied to the Trimumpara Raja and the armies of the Zamorin of Calicut and vassal Malabari states.
The celebrated heroics of the tiny Portuguese garrison led by Duarte Pacheco Pereira fended off an invading army several hundred times bigger. It proved a humiliating defeat for the Zamorin of Calicut.  He not only failed to conquer Cochin but his inability to crush the tiny opposition undermined the faith of his vassals and allies.  The Zamorin lost much of his traditional authority over the Malabar states of India in the aftermath.  The preservation of Cochin secured the continued presence of the Portuguese in India.

Bix_Beiderbecke|"Leon Bismark ""Bix"" Beiderbecke (March 10 1903 – August 6 1931) was an American jazz cornetist pianist and composer.
Beiderbecke was one of the most influential jazz soloists of the 1920s a cornet player noted for an inventive lyrical approach and purity of tone with such clarity of sound that one contemporary famously described it like ""shooting bullets at a bell"". His solos on seminal recordings such as ""Singin' the Blues"" and ""I'm Coming Virginia"" (both 1927) demonstrate a gift for extended improvisation that heralded the jazz ballad style in which jazz solos are an integral part of the composition. Moreover his use of extended chords and an ability to improvise freely along harmonic as well as melodic lines are echoed in post-WWII developments in jazz. ""In a Mist"" (1927) is the best known of Beiderbecke's published piano compositions and the only one that he recorded. His piano style reflects both jazz and classical (mainly impressionist) influences. All five of his piano compositions..."|0

Clams have two shells of equal size connected by two adductor muscles and have a powerful burrowing foot. They live in both freshwater and marine environments; in salt water they prefer to burrow down into the mud and the turbidity of the water required varies with species and location; the greatest diversity of these is in North America.Clams in the culinary sense do not live attached to a substrate (whereas oysters and mussels do) and do not live near the bottom (whereas scallops do).

Sponge|"Sponges the members of the phylum Porifera (; meaning ""pore bearer"") are a basal Metazoa (animal) clade as a sister of the Diploblasts. They are multicellular organisms that have bodies full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them consisting of jelly-like mesohyl sandwiched between two thin layers of cells. The branch of zoology that studies sponges is known as spongiology.
Sponges have unspecialized cells that can transform into other types and that often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. Sponges do not have nervous digestive or circulatory systems. Instead most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes. Sponges were first to branch off the evolutionary tree from the common ancestor of all animals making them the sister group of all other animals.

Cicadas have prominent eyes set wide apart short antennae and membranous front wings. They have an exceptionally loud song produced in most species by the rapid buckling and unbuckling of drumlike tymbals. The earliest known fossil Cicadomorpha appeared in the Upper Permian period; extant species occur all around the world in temperate to tropical climates. They typically live in trees feeding on watery sap from xylem tissue and laying their eggs in a slit in the bark. Most cicadas are cryptic. The vast majority of species are active during the day as adults with some calling..."|0

Shark|"Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the rays. However the term ""shark"" has also been used for extinct members of the subclass Elasmobranchii outside the Selachimorpha such as Cladoselache and Xenacanthus as well as other Chondrichthyes such as the holocephalid eugenedontidans.
Under this broader definition the earliest known sharks date back to more than 420 million years ago. Acanthodians are often referred to as ""spiny sharks""; though they are not part of Chondrichthyes proper they are a paraphyletic assemblage leading to cartilaginous fish as a whole.

1905_Russian_Revolution|"The Russian Revolution of 1905 also known as the First Russian Revolution was a wave of mass political and social unrest that spread through vast areas of the Russian Empire some of which was directed at the government. It included worker strikes peasant unrest and military mutinies. It led to constitutional reform (namely the ""October Manifesto"") including the establishment of the State Duma the multi-party system and the Russian Constitution of 1906.
The 1905 revolution was spurred by the Russian defeat in the Russo-Japanese War which ended in the same year but also by the growing realization by a variety of sectors of society of the need for reform. Politicians such as Sergei Witte had failed to accomplish this. While the Tsar managed to keep his rule the events foreshadowed those of the Russian revolutions in 1917 which resulted in the overthrow of the monarchy execution of the imperial family and creation of the Soviet Union by the Bolsheviks.

King Louis XIV confronted the combined opposition of the princes the nobility the law courts (parlements) and most of the French people and yet won out in the end. The dispute started when the government of France issued seven fiscal edicts six of which were to increase taxation. The parlements pushed back and questioned the constitutionality of the King's actions and sought to check his powers.The Fronde was divided into two campaigns the Parlementary Fronde and the Fronde of the Princes. The timing of the outbreak of the Parlementary Fronde directly after the Peace of Westphalia (1648) that ended the Thirty Years' War was significant. The nuclei of the armed bands that terrorized parts of France under aristocratic leaders during this period had been hardened in a generation of war in Germany where troops...|1

War_of_1812|The War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States and its allies and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and its allies. It began when the United States declared war in June 1812 and ended in a stalemate when a peace treaty agreed to earlier was ratified by the United States in February 1815. While the war ended in a draw both sides were happy with the outcome that saw the war ending although indigenous nations are generally seen among historians as the real losers. Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars while historians in Canada and the United States see it as a war in its own right. From the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France in 1803 Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France which the United States contested as illegal under international law. To man the blockade Britain pressed merchant sailors into the Royal Navy including Americans. American sentiment grew increasingly hostile...|1

Battle_of_Island_Number_Ten|"The Battle of Island Number Ten was an engagement at the New Madrid or Kentucky Bend on the Mississippi River during the American Civil War lasting from February 28 to April 8 1862. The position an island at the base of a tight double turn in the course of the river was held by the Confederates from the early days of the war. It was an excellent site to impede Union efforts to invade the South by the river as ships had to approach the island bows on and then slow to make the turns. For the defenders however it had an innate weakness in that it depended on a single road for supplies and reinforcements. If an enemy force managed to cut that road the garrison would be isolated and eventually be forced to surrender.
Union forces began the siege in March 1862 shortly after the Confederate Army abandoned their position at Columbus Kentucky. The Union Army of the Mississippi under Brigadier General John Pope made the first probes coming overland through Missouri and occupying the town..."|1

Multituberculata|"Multituberculata (commonly known as multituberculates named for the multiple tubercles of their teeth) is an extinct taxon of rodent-like allotherian mammals that existed for approximately 166 million years the longest fossil history of any mammal lineage. They eventually declined from the late Paleocene onwards disappearing in the late Eocene though they might have lived even longer into the Miocene if gondwanatheres are part of this group. More than 200 species are known ranging from mouse-sized to beaver-sized. These species occupied a diversity of ecological niches ranging from burrow-dwelling to squirrel-like arborealism to jerboa-like hoppers. Multituberculates are usually placed as crown mammals outside either of the two main groups of living mammals—Theria including placentals and marsupials and Monotremata—but closer to Theria than to monotremes.

Naval_Battle_of_the_Tejo|"The Battle of Tejo took place in July 1384 in the Tagus river (Tejo in Portuguese) between a Portuguese naval force of 34 ships (5 of which were major vessels) with the objective of supplying the besieged city of Lisbon with much needed supplies and the Castilian fleet led by Sanchez de Tovar. Although the Portuguese lost three ships (Castilian casualties are unknown) Portuguese success in reaching Lisbon and breaking the blockade with much needed supplies was a major victory for Portugal. The Castilians would later retreat from the siege.

Tuscarora_War|"The Tuscarora War was fought in North Carolina from September 22 1711 until February 11 1715 between the Tuscarora people and their allies on one side and European American settlers the Yamassee and other allies on the other. This was considered the bloodiest colonial war in North Carolina. The Tuscarora signed a treaty with colonial officials in 1718 and settled on a reserved tract of land in Bertie County North Carolina. The war incited further conflict on the part of the Tuscarora and led to changes in the slave trade of North and South Carolina.
The first successful settlement of North Carolina began in 1653. The Tuscarora lived in peace with the settlers for more than 50 years while nearly every other colony in America was involved in some conflict with Native Americans. Most of the Tuscarora migrated north to New York after the war where they joined the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy as the sixth nation.

Coral|"Corals are marine invertebrates within the class Anthozoa of the phylum Cnidaria. They typically live in compact colonies of many identical individual polyps. Coral species include the important reef builders that inhabit tropical oceans and secrete calcium carbonate to form a hard skeleton.
A coral ""group"" is a colony of myriad genetically identical polyps. Each polyp is a sac-like animal typically only a few millimeters in diameter and a few centimeters in height. A set of tentacles surround a central mouth opening. Each polyp excretes an exoskeleton near the base. Over many generations the colony thus creates a skeleton characteristic of the species which can measure up to several meters in size. Individual colonies grow by asexual reproduction of polyps. Corals also breed sexually by spawning: polyps of the same species release gametes simultaneously overnight often around a full moon. Fertilized eggs form planulae a mobile early form of the coral polyp which when mature settles..."|0

Bombardment_of_Genoa|"The Bombardment of Genoa was a military event during the War of the Reunions when France bombarded the city of Genoa from the sea between May 18 and May 28 1684.


== Background ==
The Republic of Genoa was strategically a very important ally of the Spanish Empire as the Spanish Duchy of Milan was landlocked. All transport between Spain and Milan went through the port of Genoa. Furthermore the financing of the Spanish crown by the Genoese bankers had made both countries natural allies ever since 1557 when the state bankruptcy of Philip II had ended the reign of the German Fuggers as Spanish financiers.
After the War of Devolution and the Franco-Dutch War it was clear that France had replaced Spain as the most powerful country in Europe. In October 1683 France annexed some territory in the Spanish Netherlands starting the War of the Reunions. When Spain sent reinforcements via the port of Genoa the French decided to punish the city.

Take_Ichi_convoy|"The Take-Ichi sendan (竹一船団 ""Bamboo No. One"" convoy) was a Japanese convoy of World War II. The convoy left Shanghai on 17 April 1944 carrying two infantry divisions to reinforce Japan's defensive positions in the Philippines and western New Guinea. United States Navy (USN) submarines attacked the convoy on 26 April and 6 May sinking four transports and killing more than 4000 soldiers. These losses caused the convoy to be diverted to Halmahera where the surviving soldiers and their equipment were unloaded.
The Take Ichi convoy's losses had important strategic results. The failure to bring the two divisions to their destination without loss contributed to the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters' decision to move Japan's defensive perimeter back by 600 mi (970 km). The divisions' combat power was also blunted by their losses and while they both saw action against United States Army forces they contributed little to Japan's attempt to defend its empire.

Battle_of_Pollilur_(1781)|"The Battle of Pollilur was fought on 27 August 1781 between forces of the Kingdom of Mysore under Hyder Ali and British East India Company forces led by General Eyre Coote. The battle was fought on the site of a 1780 encounter in which a Company force was almost completely routed or captured.
In the 1781 battle the company's army was organized into two lines. One line fought against the troops under Tipu Sultan. But Hyder Ali's army faced severe casualties and retreated to Kanchipuram.
After the battle a shortage of provisions led Coote to move his forces toward Tripassore. Both the sides retreated in a drawn battle and both claimed victory by firing a salute though the English claimed ""dubious victory"".

Battle_of_Mount_Cadmus|"The Battle of Mount Cadmus took place near Laodicea at Honaz on January 6 1148 during the Second Crusade. The French crusader army led by Louis VII of France was defeated by the Seljuks of Rum.


== Background ==
The ill-disciplined Crusaders especially in the German Crusade had caused a number of incidents with the passage of the crusading army through the Balkans. The Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus feared that the troops of the crusaders would strengthen the Principality of Antioch which he wanted to restore to his sovereignty and also would weaken the Byzantine-German alliance against Roger II of Sicily. While Conrad III and Louis VII refused to pay homage to the Byzantine emperor in the autumn of 1147 they retained the Byzantine troops. Consequently Roger II seized Corfu and Cephalonia and plundered Corinth and Thebes.
The French and Germans decided to take separate routes. Conrad's army was defeated at the Battle of Dorylaeum October 25 1147.

Naval_battles_of_the_American_Revolutionary_War|The American Revolutionary War saw a series of military manoeuvres and battles involving naval forces of the British Royal Navy and the Continental Navy from 1775 and of the French Navy from 1778 onwards. While the British enjoyed more numerical victories these battles culminated in the surrender of the British Army force of Lieutenant-General Earl Charles Cornwallis an event that led directly to the beginning of serious peace negotiations and the eventual end of the war. From the start of the hostilities the British North American station under Vice-Admiral Samuel Graves blockaded the major colonial ports and carried raids against patriot communities. Colonial forces could do little to stop these developments due to British naval supremacy. In 1777 colonial privateers made raids into British waters capturing merchant ships which they took into French and Spanish ports although both were officially neutral.

Jay|"Jays are several species of medium-sized usually colorful and noisy passerine birds in the crow family Corvidae. The evolutionary relationships between the jays and the magpies are rather complex. For example the Eurasian magpie seems more closely related to the Eurasian jay than to the East Asian blue and green magpies whereas the blue jay is not closely related to either.


== Systematics and species ==
Jays are not a monophyletic group. Anatomical and molecular evidence indicates they can be divided into an American and an Old World lineage (the latter including the ground jays and the piapiac) while the gray jays of the genus Perisoreus form a group of their own.  The black magpie formerly believed to be related to jays is classified as a treepie.  The crested jay (Platylophus galericulatus) is traditionally placed here but its placement remains unresolved; it does not seem to be a corvid at all.

Giant's_Causeway_(horse)|"<p>In folklore <b>giants</b> (from Latin and Ancient Greek: <i>gigas</i> cognate giga-) are beings of human appearance but are at times prodigious in size and strength or bear an otherwise notable appearance. The word <i>giant</i> first attested in 1297 was derived from the <i>Gigantes</i> (Greek: <span lang=""grc"" title=""Ancient Greek (to 1453) language text"">Γίγαντες</span>) of Greek mythology.
</p><p>Fairy tales such as ""Jack the Giant Killer"" have formed the modern perception of giants as stupid and violent monsters sometimes said to eat humans while other giants tend to eat the livestock. The antagonist in ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" is often described as a giant. In some more recent portrayals like those of Jonathan Swift and Roald Dahl some giants are both intelligent and friendly.
</p>


<h2><span id=""Literary_and_cultural_analysis"">Literary and cultural analysis</span></h2>
<p>Giants appear in the folklore of cultures worldwide as they represent a relatively simple concept. Representing the human body enlarged to the point of being monstrous giants evoke terror and remind humans of their body's frailty and mortality. They are often portrayed as monsters and antagonists but there are exceptions. Some giants intermingle with humans in a friendly way and can even be part of human families with their offspring being portrayed as regular humans.</p>

<ul><li>the Anakites</li>
<li>the Emites</li>
<li>the Amorites</li>
<li>the Rephaites</li></ul><p>The Book of Numbers includes the discouraging report by the spies which Moses sent into Canaan: “We can’t attack those people; they are stronger than we are. (...) All the people we saw there are of great size.  We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes and we looked the same to them.” However the Book of Joshua describing the actual conquest of Canaan in a later generation makes no reference to such people living there.
</p><p>The Bible also tells of Gog and Magog who later entered European folklore and of the famous battle between David and the Philistine Goliath. While Goliath is often portrayed as a giant in retellings of the Biblical narrative he is much smaller than other biblical giants. The 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus and the 1st-2nd-century BC Dead Sea Scrolls give Goliath's height as ""four cubits and a span"" approximately 2.00 m or about six feet seven inches.  The King James translation of the Bible reports the giant Goliath as ""six cubits and a span"" in height—about nine feet nine inches tall (over 2.75 m) (1Samuel 17:4 KJV) but the Septuagint a Greek Bible gives Goliath's height as ""four cubits and a span"" (~2.00 m). For comparison the Anakites are described as making the Israelites seem like grasshoppers. See also Gibborim.

<p>Hayk was known as the founder of the Armenian state. Hayk was part of a race of giants who helped construct the tower of Babel.

Among the giants he was the bravest and most famous opponent of all who raised their hand to become absolute ruler over the giants and heroes.""</p><p>Mount Nemrut is known to have received its name from an Armenian tradition in which Nimrod was killed by an arrow shot by Hayk during a massive battle between two rival armies of giants to the southeast of Lake Van.</p>

<p>According to Baltic mythology the playing of a giantess named Neringa on the seashore formed the Curonian Spit (""neria nerge neringia"" means land which is diving up and down like a swimmer). This character also appears in other myths (in some of which she is shown as a young strong woman similar to a female version of the Greek Heracles). ""Neringa"" is the name of a modern town on the spot.

<p>Giants are rough but generally righteous characters of formidable strength living up the hills of the Basque Country. Giants stand for the Basque people reluctant to convert to Christianity who decide to stick to the old life style and customs in the forest. Sometimes they hold the secret of ancient techniques and wisdom unknown to the Christians like in the legend of San Martin Txiki while their most outstanding feature is their strength. It follows that in many legends all over the Basque territory the giants are held accountable for the creation of many stone formations hills and ages-old megalithic structures (dolmens etc.) with similar explanations provided in different spots.
</p><p>However giants show different variants and forms they are most frequently referred to as jentilak and mairuak while as individuals they can be represented as Basajaun (""the lord of the forests"") Sanson (development of the biblical Samson) Errolan (based on the Frankish army general Roland who fell dead at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass) or even Tartalo (a one-eyed giant akin to the Greek Cyclops Polyphemus).

<h3><span id=""Bulgarian"">Bulgarian</span></h3>

<p>In Bulgarian mythology giants called ispolini inhabited the Earth before modern humans. They lived in the mountains fed on raw meat and often fought against dragons. Ispolini were afraid of blackberries which posed a danger of tripping and dying so they offered sacrifices to that plant.</p>

<p>In Greek mythology the <i>Gigantes</i> (γίγαντες) were (according to the poet Hesiod) the children of Uranus (Ουρανός) and Gaia (Γαία) (spirits of the sky and the earth) where some depictions had them with snake-like legs. They were involved in a conflict with the Olympian gods called the <i>Gigantomachy</i> (Γιγαντομαχία) when Gaia had them attack Mount Olympus. This battle was eventually settled when the hero Heracles decided to help the Olympians. The Greeks believed some of them like Enceladus to lie buried from that time under the earth and that their tormented quivers resulted in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
</p><p>Herodotus in Book 1 Chapter 68 describes how the Spartans uncovered in Tegea the body of Orestes which was seven cubits long—around 10 feet (3 meters). In his book <i>The Comparison of Romulus with Theseus</i> Plutarch describes how the Athenians uncovered the body of Theseus which was <i>of more than ordinary size</i>. The kneecaps of Ajax were exactly the size of a discus for the boy's pentathlon wrote Pausanias. A boy's discus was about twelve centimeters in diameter while a normal adult patella is around five centimeters suggesting Ajax may have been around 14 feet (~4.3 meters) tall.
</p><p>The Cyclopes are also compared to giants due to their huge size (Polyphemus son of Poseidon and Thoosa and nemesis of Odysseus comes to mind). The Elder Cyclopes were the children of Gaia and Uranus where they later made Zeus' Master Thunderbolt Poseidon's Trident and Hades' Helm of Darkness during the Titanomachy.
</p><p>The Hecatoncheires are giants that have 100 arms and 50 heads who were also the children of Gaia and Uranus.
</p><p>Other known giant races in Greek mythology include the six-armed Gegeines the northern Hyperboreans and the cannibalistic Laestrygonians.

<h3><span id=""Hindu"">Hindu</span></h3>
<p>In Hinduism the giants are called Daityas. The Daityas (दैत्य) were the children of Diti and the sage Kashyapa who fought against the gods or Devas because they were jealous of their Deva half-brothers. Since Daityas were a power-seeking race they sometimes allied with other races having similar ideology namely Danavas and Asuras. Daityas along with Danavas and Asuras are sometimes called Rakshasas the generic term for a demon in Hindu mythology. Some known Daityas include Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha. The main antagonist of the Hindu epic Ramayana Ravana was a Brahmin from his father's side and a Daitya from his mother's side. His younger brother Kumbhakarna was said to be as tall as a mountain and was quite good natured. There are also accounts stating humans grew to the size of giants during the Satya Yuga.</p>

<p>According to Paiute oral history the Si-Te-Cah or Sai'i are a legendary tribe of red-haired cannibalistic giants the remains of which were allegedly found in 1911 by guano miners in Nevada's Lovelock Cave. Furthermore the Paiute creation story tells of ""beautiful giants"" who once lived between the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains. After giving birth to a disfigured child the giants treated the child so poorly that the Great Spirit responded by making the land hot and desolate and allowing enemies to conquer the giants. Only two giants survived: Paiute and his wife both of whose skin became brown from eternally living in the hot desert.</p><p>Adrienne Mayor writes about the Si-Te-Cah in her book <i>Legends of the First Americans</i>. She suggests that the 'giant' interpretation of the skeletons from Lovelock Cave and other dry caves in Nevada was started by entrepreneurs setting up tourist displays and that the skeletons themselves were of normal size. However about a hundred miles north of Lovelock there are plentiful fossils of mammoths and cave bears and their large limb bones could easily be thought to be those of giants by an untrained observer. She also discusses the reddish hair pointing out that hair pigment is not stable after death and that various factors such as temperature soil etc. can turn ancient very dark hair rusty red or orange.

<p>In Norse mythology the Jotun (<i>jötnar</i> in Old Norse a cognate with <i>ettin</i>) are often opposed to the gods. While often translated as ""giants"" most are described as being roughly human-sized. Some are portrayed as huge such as frost giants (<i>hrímþursar</i>) fire giants (<i>eldjötnar</i>) and mountain giants (<i>bergrisar</i>).
</p><p>The giants are the origin of most of various monsters in Norse mythology (e.g. the Fenrisulfr) and in the eventual battle of Ragnarök the giants will storm Asgard and fight the gods until the world is destroyed. Even so the gods themselves were related to the giants by many marriages and there are giants such as Ægir Loki Mímir and Skaði who bear little difference in status to them. The chief god Odin was the great-grandson of the giant Ymir.
</p><p>Norse mythology also holds that the entire world of men was created from the flesh of Ymir a giant of cosmic proportions whose name is considered by some scholars to share a root with Yama of Indo-Iranian mythology.
</p><p>An old Icelandic legend says that two night-prowling giants a man and a woman were traversing the fjord near Drangey Island with their cow when they were surprised by the bright rays of daybreak. As a result of exposure to daylight all three were turned into stone. Drangey represents the cow and Kerling (supposedly the female giant the name means ""old hag"") is to the south of it. Karl (the male giant) was to the north of the island but he disappeared long ago.

<h3><span id=""Other_European"">Other European</span></h3>

<p>In folklore from all over Europe giants were believed to have built the remains of previous civilizations. Saxo Grammaticus for example argues that giants had to exist because nothing else would explain the large walls stone monuments and statues that we now know were the remains of Roman construction. Similarly the Old English poem <i>Seafarer</i> speaks of the high stone walls that were the work of giants. Even natural geologic features such as the massive basalt columns of the Giant's Causeway on the coast of Northern Ireland were attributed to construction by giants. Giants provided the least complicated explanation for such artifacts.
</p><p>Medieval romances such as the Spanish <i>Amadís de Gaula</i> feature giants as antagonists or rarely as allies. This is parodied famously in Cervantes' <i>Don Quixote</i> when the title character attacks a windmill believing it to be a giant. This is the source of the phrase tilting at windmills.
</p><p>Tales of combat with giants were a common feature in the folklore of Wales Scotland and Ireland.  Celtic giants also figure in Breton and Arthurian romances perhaps as a reflection of the Nordic and Slavic mythology that arrived on the boats and from this source they spread into the heroic tales of Torquato Tasso Ludovico Ariosto and their follower Edmund Spenser.  In the small Scottish village of Kinloch Rannoch a local myth to this effect concerns a local hill that apparently resembles the head shoulders and torso of a man and has therefore been termed 'the sleeping giant'. Apparently the giant will awaken only if a specific musical instrument is played near the hill. Other giants perhaps descended from earlier Germanic mythology feature as frequent opponents of Dietrich von Bern in medieval German tales – in later portrayals Dietrich himself and his fellow heroes also became giants.
</p><p>Many giants in English folklore were noted for their stupidity.  A giant who had quarreled with the Mayor of Shrewsbury went to bury the city with dirt; however he met a shoemaker carrying shoes to repair and the shoemaker convinced the giant that he had worn out all the shoes coming from Shrewsbury and so it was too far to travel.</p><p>Other English stories told of how giants threw stones at each other. This was used to explain many great stones on the landscape.</p><p>Giants figure in a great many fairy tales and folklore stories such as <i>Jack the Giant Killer</i> <i>The Giant Who Had No Heart in His Body</i> <i>Nix Nought Nothing</i> <i>Robin Hood and the Prince of Aragon</i> <i>Young Ronald</i> and Paul Bunyan. Ogres and trolls are humanoid creatures sometimes of gigantic stature that occur in various sorts of European folklore. An example of another Slavic folklore giant is Rübezahl a kind giant from Wendish folklore who lived in the Giant Mountains (nowadays on the Czech–Polish border). Additionally mythological beings which are not necessarily considered giants in the common sense can be characterized by a giant-like body size e.g. the Bergmönch a German mountain spirit.</p><p>In the <i>Kalevala</i> Antero Vipunen is a giant shaman that possesses mighty spells dating to the creation. The epic hero Väinämöinen sets out to learn these spells from him but Vipunen is buried underground and when Väinämöinen digs him out he is accidentally swallowed by Vipunen. Väinämöinen then forces Vipunen to submit and sing the spells out by hammering his insides. An analysis by Martti Haavio is that Vipunen is not physically large but his familiar animal (astral form) is a whale. The depiction is not found in the majority of Finnish original stories and most probably originates from the book's compiler Elias Lönnrot.</p>
<h2><span id=""Fossil_evidence"">Fossil evidence</span></h2>
<p>Through the centuries certain archaeologists have searched for fossil evidence of a race of giants. Alleged evidence includes:
</p>
<ul><li>The Giant of Castelnau: Estimated at 11 feet 6 inches (3.5 m) tall. Discovered by the anthropologist Georges Vacher de Lapouge at the Bronze Age cemetery of Castelnau-le-Lez France in the winter of 1890.</li>
<li>1894 press accounts mentioned a discovery of bones of human giants unearthed at a prehistoric cemetery at Montpellier France. Skulls ""28 31 and 32 inches in circumference"" were reported alongside other bones of gigantic proportions which indicated they belonged to a race of men ""between 10 and 15 feet in height."" The bones were reportedly sent to the Paris Academy for further study.</li>
<li>The remains of the Si-Te-Cah or Sai'i a legendary tribe of red-haired cannibalistic giants which were allegedly found in 1911 by guano miners in Nevada's Lovelock Cave. However the size and nature of the fossil remains has been disputed by Adrienne Mayor in the book <i>Fossil Legends of the First Americans</i>.</li></ul><h2><span id=""In_popular_culture"">In popular culture</span></h2>

He also produced religious art satire and Reformation propaganda and he made a significant contribution to the history of book design. He is called ""the Younger"" to distinguish him from his father Hans Holbein the Elder an accomplished painter of the Late Gothic school.
Holbein was born in Augsburg but he worked mainly in Basel as a young artist. At first he painted murals and religious works designed stained glass windows and printed books. He also painted an occasional portrait making his international mark with portraits of humanist Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam.

Second_Battle_of_Chuenpi|"The Second Battle of Chuenpi was fought between British and Chinese forces in the Pearl River Delta Guangdong province China on 7 January 1841 during the First Opium War. The British launched an amphibious attack at the Humen strait (Bogue) capturing the forts on the islands of Chuenpi and Taikoktow. Subsequent negotiations between British Plenipotentiary Charles Elliot and Chinese Imperial Commissioner Qishan resulted in the Convention of Chuenpi on 20 January. As one of the terms of the agreement Elliot announced the cession of Hong Kong Island to the British Empire after which the British took formal possession of the island on 26 January.


== Background ==
In September 1840 the Daoguang Emperor of the Qing dynasty fired Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu and replaced him with Qishan.

Lamian_War|"The Lamian War or the Hellenic War (323–322 BC) was fought by a coalition of cities including Athens and the Aetolian League against Macedon and its ally Boeotia. The war broke out after the death of the King of Macedon Alexander the Great and was part of a series of attempts to challenge Macedonian hegemony over mainland Greece.
The war takes its name from the protracted siege of the Macedonian forces at Lamia. Although the Athenian coalition was initially successful against the Macedonian forces in Europe their inability to take the city of Lamia and their failure to retain control of the sea gave the Macedonians time to bring reinforcements from Asia and secure victory.


== Prelude ==
In 324 BC Alexander the Great had the Exiles Decree proclaimed in Greece. The effect of this decree was that citizens of Greek cities that had previously been exiled would be able to return to their cities of origin. Though this affected many of the cities of Greece two regions where this had a major..."|1
Ouachita_madtom|"The Ouachita madtom (Noturus lachneri) is a catfish of the family Ictaluridae.The first specimens of the species were collected in 1952 it was not until 1969 that they were recognised as a species. The Ouachita madtom is similar to the tadpole madtom except the Ouachita madtom has one internasal pore while the tadpole madtom has two and 16 to 18 anal rays while the tadpole madtom has only 14 to 16. It is also similar to the slender madtom but differing in the sack of serrae on the pectoral spine having more caudal rays and usually eight pectoral rays while the slender madtom has 9. The maximum length of an Ouachita madtom is about 2.7 inches.


== Distribution ==
The Ouachita madtom was considered an Endangered Species by the IUCN in 1986 and 1988 but assessments in 1990 and 1994 showed it to be vulnerable. The Ouachita madtom is found only in the upper forks of the Saline River (Ouachita River) system and in one tributary of the Ouachita River in Central Arkansas United States.

Siege_of_Roxburgh_Castle|"The Siege of Roxburgh was a siege that took place in 1314 which was a major conflict in the First War of Scottish Independence. Sir James Douglas Lord of Douglas after his victory over the Clan MacDougall had been capturing several castles back from the English but the mere thought of taking Roxburgh Castle was one that daunted him. It was on impregnable ground and was guarded well. He and Walter Stewart 6th High Steward of Scotland disguised their few men as cows so the garrison was unaware of their presence. They then used ladders to climb to the top and took the castle by total surprise. They inflicted heavy casualties on the garrison including wounding their leader in the face with an arrow. This siege was a prelude to the Battle of Bannockburn.The Lanercost Chronicle records that ""all that beautiful castle the Scots pulled down to the ground like the other castles that they had succeeded in capturing lest the English should ever again rule the land by holding the castles..."|1
Nightjar|"Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal or crepuscular birds in the subfamily Caprimulginae and in the family Caprimulgidae characterised by long wings short legs and very short bills. Some New World species are called nighthawks. The English word ""nightjar"" originally referred to the European nightjar.
Nightjars are found around the world except in New Zealand and some islands of Oceania. They usually nest on the ground with a habit of resting and roosting on roads.
The subfamilies of nightjars have similar characteristics including small feet of little use for walking and long pointed wings. However typical nightjars have rictal bristles longer bills and softer plumage. The colour of their plumage and their unusual perching habits help conceal them during the day.

== The main battle ==
The battle began on 19 December 2015 when the loyalists captured the city of Haradh after fierce fighting left dozens dead on both sides. The port was a very strategic location for the Houthis because Port Midi was used to supply weapons to the capital Sana'a and for using the surrounding area to launch missiles against Saudi Arabian villages. At the end of December the loyalists advanced very quickly as they managed to capture the surrounding area pushing the Houthis back. The Houthi fighters suffered airstrikes..."|1

Battle_of_4_May|"The Battle of 4 May was fought in open sea near Salvador Bahia on 4 May 1823 between the Brazilian Navy under the command of a former admiral of the British Royal Navy Thomas Cochrane and the Portuguese Navy during the Brazilian War of Independence.


== Background ==
During the period of Portuguese control of Brazil commerce had been largely restricted to Portuguese ships with Portuguese crews; so few Brazilians had the opportunity to become proficient sailors. Following the Brazilian Declaration of Independence from Portugal in September 1822 Brazil began assembling a fleet of warships; but had difficulty finding trained sailors to man those ships. In December 1822 Brazil solicited English mercenaries with the offer of Portuguese prizes.

Estuary_perch|"The estuary perch (Macquaria colonorum) is a species of temperate perch endemic to south-eastern Australia where it prefers brackish waters such as lower tidal reaches of coastal lakes rivers and streams.


== Appearance ==
It is very similar to and very closely related to its sister species the Australian bass Macquaria novemaculeata differing in having a slightly more ""scooped"" forehead and reaching a larger length of 75 cm (30 in).  Most individuals only reach around 40 cm (16 in).  The greatest recorded weight for a specimen of this species is 10 kg (22 lb) there is very little evidence for this most people assume it was a typo i.e. it was 10 lb and not 10 kg.

Estuary perch breed in winter at the same time as Australian bass and are similarly sexually dimorphic with females larger than males. Females reach sexual maturity at older ages and larger sizes than males. In Victoria estuary perch/Australian bass hybrids are regularly recorded; most hybrids appear..."|0
Horse-chestnut_leaf_miner|"The horse-chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) is a leaf-mining moth of the family Gracillariidae. The horse-chestnut leaf miner was first observed in North Macedonia in 1984 and was described as a new species in 1986. Its larvae are leaf miners on the common horse-chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum). The horse-chestnut leafminer was first collected and inadvertently pressed in herbarium sheets by the botanist Theodor von Heldreich in central Greece in 1879.


== Damage ==

Cameraria ohridella causes significant damage mainly late summer browning to the appearance of horse-chestnut trees. Despite the poor appearance of these infested trees there is no evidence that damage by the moth leads to tree death. Seed weight photosynthetic storage and reproductive capacity may however be reduced. Trees survive repeated infestations and re-flush normally in the following year. It appears that most of the damage caused by the moth occurs too late in the growing season to greatly affect tree..."|0
Dorididae|"Sea lemon is a loosely applied common name for a group of medium-sized to large shell-less colorful sea slugs or nudibranchs specifically dorid nudibranchs in the taxonomic family Dorididae and other closely related families. These are marine gastropod mollusks.
The Monterey sea lemon is Doris montereyensis and the mottled pale sea lemon is Diaulula lentiginosa.
The common name sea lemon probably comes from these animal's visual similarity to a lemon based on such qualities as the roughened skin the oval form when seen from above and the common but not inevitable orange to pale yellow coloration.


== Description ==
These dorid nudibranchs can be large (up to 20 cm) rather flattened and oval in shape when seen from above. They have two hornlike projections (rhinophores) on the head and a rosette-like tuft of gills on the back of the animal. The mantle is sometimes sprinkled with black dots and it is covered in small bumps which are called tubercles.

The Abyssinian occupation of Yemen continued until about 570 when a Yemeni national reaction was provoked against Masruq ibn Abraha. The leader of this patriotic movement was a scion of the Himyarite royal line Sayf ibn Dhi-Yazan. He first tried vainly to get help from the Byzantines and Lakhmids but then began direct negotiations with the Sassanid king Khosrau I. The king was reluctant to intervene in a region so distant from Persia but in the end agreed to send a force of eight hundred cavalrymen of Dailamite origin in one version men of good birth who had been consigned to prison but were now given a chance to redeem themselves by achieving victory.

Sea_butterfly|"Sea butterflies scientific name Thecosomata (thecosomes ""case/shell-body"") are a taxonomic suborder of small pelagic swimming sea snails. These are holoplanktonic opisthobranch gastropod mollusks in the informal group Opisthobranchia.  They include some of the world's most abundant gastropod species.Along with its sister group the Gymnosomata this group is included in the pteropods. The validity of this clade is not unanimously established; although it had fallen out of favour for a number of years recent molecular evidence suggests that the taxon should be resurrected. 
Most Thecosomata have a calcified shell whereas mature Gymnosomata do not.


== Morphology ==

These snails float and swim freely in the water and are carried along with the currents. This has led to a number of adaptations in their bodies. The shell and the gill have disappeared in several families. Their foot has taken the form of two wing-like lobes or parapodia which propel the animal through the sea by slow..."|0

Natantia|"Natantia (Boas 1880) is an obsolete taxon of decapod crustaceans comprising those families that move predominantly by swimming – the shrimp (comprising Caridea and Procarididea) prawns (Dendrobranchiata) and boxer shrimp. The remaining Decapoda were placed in the Reptantia and consisted of crabs lobsters and other large animals that move chiefly by walking along the bottom. The division between Natantia and Reptantia was replaced in 1963 when Martin Burkenroad erected the suborder Pleocyemata for those animals that brood their eggs on the pleopods leaving Dendrobranchiata for the prawns. Under this system Natantia is a paraphyletic group. Burkenroad's primary division of Decapoda into Dendrobranchiata and Pleocyemata has since been corroborated by molecular analyses.

The name Natantia Owen 1851 was utilized in a phylogenetic context by Madzia and Cau (2017) as the most exclusive mosasaurid clade including Mosasaurus and Tylosaurus but not Halisaurus.

Owl_butterfly|"The owl butterflies are species of the genus Caligo and are known for their huge eyespots which resemble owls' eyes. They are found in the rainforests and secondary forests of Mexico Central and South America.
Owl butterflies are very large 65–200 mm (2.6–7.9 in) and fly only a few meters at a time so avian predators have little difficulty in following them to their settling place. However the butterflies preferentially fly in dusk when few avian predators are around.
The Latin name may possibly refer to their active periods; caligo means darkness.
Some owl butterflies form leks in mating behavior.

Alkali_bee|"The alkali bee Nomia melanderi is a ground-nesting bee native to deserts and semi-arid desert basins of the western United States. It was described by Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell in 1906.
This bee nests in salt-saturated or alkaline soil. Like some other bees such as Megachile rotundata alkali bees are an effective pollinator of alfalfa. The bee uses a specialized technique of opening alfalfa flowers for pollination by applying pressure to snap open the keel of the flower.  Due to the unusual nesting habits of this bee farmers have developed methods to accommodate them with salty mud-fields where they can burrow and lay their eggs. Farmers started doing this after realizing that plowing up natural flats like these decreased the yield of alfalfa dramatically.It is preyed upon by the conopid fly Zodion obliquefasciatum.Juvenile hormone (JH) analog methoprene can serve as a possible limiting factor for alkali bees since female bees are more likely to reach reproductive maturity with..."|0

Orfelia_fultoni|"Orfelia fultoni is one of the bioluminescent species of flies found in North America. It is distantly related to Arachnocampa but their bioluminescent systems use distinct mechanisms. The larvae of the species live in stream banks among moss and rock cavities as well as in wet sandstone caves. They build sticky webs and using their two bioluminescent lanterns as an attractant capture flying prey. They produce the bluest light of any studied bioluminescent insect. The species occurs in the Appalachian Mountains and Cumberland Plateau primarily in the states of Alabama North Carolina Tennessee and Virginia.Orfelia fultoni has sometimes been referred to by the common name ""dismalites"" in consequence of their presence in Dismals Canyon a National Natural Landmark in northwest Alabama.

1757_Hajj_caravan_raid|"The 1757 Hajj caravan raid was the plunder and massacre of the Hajj caravan of 1757 on its return to Damascus from Mecca by Bedouin tribesmen. The caravan was under the protection of an Ottoman force led by the Wali (provincial governor) of Damascus Husayn Pasha and his deputy Musa Pasha while the Bedouin were led by Qa'dan al-Fa'iz of the Bani Sakhr tribe. An estimated 20000 pilgrims were either killed or died of hunger or thirst as a result of the raid.
Although Bedouin raids on the Hajj caravan were fairly common the 1757 raid represented the peak of such attacks. Historian Aref Abu-Rabia called it the ""most famous"" raid against a Hajj caravan. The attack caused a crisis in the Ottoman Government. Husayn Pasha was dismissed and senior officials such as the kizlar agha (chief eunuch) Aboukouf and the former wali of Damascus As'ad Pasha al-Azm were executed for their alleged negligence or involvement respectively.

The mosquito life cycle consists of egg larva pupa and adult stages. Eggs are laid on the water surface; they hatch into motile larvae that feed on aquatic algae and organic material. The adult females of most species have tube-like mouthparts (called a proboscis) that can pierce the skin of a host and feed on blood which contains protein and iron needed to produce eggs. Thousands of mosquito species feed on the blood of various hosts ⁠— vertebrates including mammals birds reptiles amphibians and some fish; along with some invertebrates primarily..."|0

Dryas_monkey|"The Dryas monkey (Cercopithecus dryas) also known as Salonga monkey ekele or inoko is a little-known species of guenon found only in the Congo Basin restricted to the left bank of the Congo River. It is now established that the animals that had been classified as Cercopithecus salongo (the common name being Zaire Diana monkey) were in fact Dryas monkeys. Some older sources treat the Dryas monkey as a subspecies of the Diana monkey and classify it as C. diana dryas but it is geographically isolated from any known Diana monkey population.
While the Dryas monkey had been considered data deficient evidence suggests it is very rare and its total population possibly numbers fewer than 200 individuals. Consequently its status was changed to critically endangered in the 2008 IUCN Red List. Along with being listed by the IUCN this species is also listed on Appendix II of CITES.

Even-toed_ungulate|"The even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla from Ancient Greek  ἄρτιος ártios 'even' and  δάκτυλος dáktylos 'finger / toe') are ungulates—hoofed animals—which bear weight equally on two (an even number) of their five toes: the third and fourth. The other three toes are either present absent vestigial or pointing posteriorly. By contrast odd-toed ungulates bear weight on one (an odd number) of the five toes: the third toe. Another difference between the two is that even-toed ungulates digest plant cellulose in one or more stomach chambers rather than in their intestine as the odd-toed ungulates do.
The aquatic cetaceans (whales dolphins and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulates so modern taxonomic classification combines the two under the name Cetartiodactyla.

Crusade_of_1197|"The Crusade of 1197 also known as the Crusade of Henry VI (German: Kreuzzug Heinrichs VI.) or the German Crusade (Deutscher Kreuzzug) was a crusade launched by the Hohenstaufen emperor Henry VI in response to the aborted attempt of his father Emperor Frederick I during the Third Crusade in 1189–90. 
Thus the military campaign is also known as the ""Emperor's Crusade"" (echoing the name ""Kings' Crusade"" given to the Third Crusade).While his forces were already on their way to the Holy Land Henry VI died before his departure in Messina on 28 September 1197. The emerging throne conflict between his brother Philip of Swabia and the Welf rival Otto of Brunswick made many higher-ranking crusaders return to Germany in order to protect their interests in the next imperial election. The nobles remaining on the campaign captured the Levant coast between Tyre and Tripoli before returning to Germany. The Crusade ended after the Christians captured Sidon and Beirut from the Muslims in 1198.

Windowpane_oyster|"The windowpane oyster (Placuna placenta) is a bivalve marine mollusk in the family of Placunidae. They are edible but valued more for their shells (and the rather small pearls). The shells have been used for thousands of years as a glass substitute because of their durability and translucence. More recently they have been used in the manufacture of decorative items such as chandeliers and lampshades; in this use the shell is known as the capiz or kapis. Capiz shells are also used as raw materials for glue chalk and varnish.

Distribution extends from the shallows of the Gulf of Aden to around the Philippines where it is abundant in the eponymous province of Capiz. The mollusks are found in muddy or sandy shores in bays coves and lagoons to a depth of about 100 m (330 ft).

He initially apprenticed with Vincenzo Malò (c. 1605-c. 1650) a Flemish artist who had studied with Teniers the Elder and Rubens. Vassallo appears to have been influenced by his fellow Genoese Sinibaldo Scorza and Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione.He painted a St. Francis with Three female saints (1648) for the church of San Gerolamo in Quarto. Vassallo also painted a Martyrdom of Saint Marcello Mastrilli' (1664) for the Convento di Carignano.
Vassallo also painted portraits yet no portraits by Vassallo are known at present.
The closest follower of Vassallo's still-life style is Giovanni Agostino Cassana (c. 1658-1720).

Hawk|"Hawks are a group of medium-sized diurnal birds of prey of the family Accipitridae. Hawks are widely distributed and vary greatly in size.

The subfamily Accipitrinae includes goshawks sparrowhawks sharp-shinned hawks and others. This subfamily are mainly woodland birds with long tails and high visual acuity. They hunt by dashing suddenly from a concealed perch.
In America members of the Buteo group are also called hawks; this group is called buzzards in other parts of the world. Generally buteos have broad wings and sturdy builds. They are relatively larger-winged shorter-tailed and fly further distances in open areas than accipiters. Buteos descend or pounce on their prey rather than hunting in a fast horizontal pursuit.The terms accipitrine hawk and buteonine hawk are used to distinguish between the types in regions where hawk applies to both. The term ""true hawk""  is sometimes used for the accipitrine hawks in regions where buzzard is preferred for the buteonine hawks.

In Genesis 1:27 ""adam"" is used in the collective sense and the interplay between the individual ""Adam"" and the collective ""humankind"" is a main literary component to the events that occur in the Garden of Eden the ambiguous meanings embedded throughout the moral sexual and spiritual terms of the narrative reflecting the complexity of the human condition. Genesis 2:7 is the first verse where ""Adam"" takes on the sense of an individual man (the first man) and the context of sex is absent; the gender distinction of ""adam"" is then reiterated in Genesis 5:1–2 by defining ""male and female"".</p>
<h3><span id=""Connection_to_the_earth"">Connection to the earth</span></h3>
<p>A recurring literary motif is the bond between Adam and the earth (<i>adamah</i>): God creates Adam by molding him out of clay in the final stages of the creation narrative. After the loss of innocence God curses Adam and the earth as punishment for his disobedience. Adam and humanity are cursed to die and return to the earth (or ground) from which he was formed. This ""earthly"" aspect is a component of Adam's identity and Adam's curse of estrangement from the earth seems to describe humankind's divided nature of being earthly yet separated from nature. God himself  who took of the dust from all four corners of the earth with each color (red black white and green) then created Adam therewith where the soul of Adam is the image of God.</p>
<h2><span id=""In_the_Hebrew_Bible"">In the Hebrew Bible</span></h2>


<p>Genesis 1 tells of God's creation of the world and its creatures with humankind as the last of his creatures: ""Male and female created He them and blessed them and called their name Adam ..."" (Genesis 5:2). God blesses mankind commands them to ""be fruitful and multiply"" and gives them ""dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth"" (Genesis 1.26–27).
</p><p>In Genesis 2 God forms ""Adam"" this time meaning a single male human out of ""the dust of the ground"" and ""breathed into his nostrils the breath of life"" (Genesis 2:7). God then places this first man in the Garden of Eden telling him that ""Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die"" (Genesis 2:16–17). God notes that ""It is not good that the man should be alone"" (Genesis 2:18) and brings the animals to Adam who gives them their names but among all the animals there was not found a companion for him (Genesis 2:20). God causes a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and forms a woman (Genesis 2:21–22) and Adam awakes and greets her as his helpmate.
</p><p><span>Genesis 3</span> the story of the Fall: A serpent persuades the woman to disobey God's command and eat of the tree of knowledge which gives wisdom. Woman convinces Adam to do likewise whereupon they become conscious of their nakedness cover themselves and hide from the sight of God. God questions Adam who blames the woman. God passes judgment first upon the serpent condemned to go on his belly then the woman condemned to pain in childbirth and subordination to her husband and finally Adam who is condemned to labour on the earth for his food and to return to it on his death. God then expels the man and woman from the garden lest they eat of the Tree of Life and become immortal.
</p><p>The chiastic structure of the death oracle given to Adam in <span>Genesis 3:19</span> forms a link between man's creation from ""dust"" (<span>Genesis 2:7</span>) to the ""return"" of his beginnings.</p>
<dl><dd><b>A</b> you return

<dd><b>B'</b> and to dust</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>A'</b> you will return</dd></dl><p><span>Genesis 4</span> deals with the birth of Adam's sons Cain and Abel and the story of the first murder followed by the birth of a third son Seth. <span>Genesis 5</span> the Book of the Generations of Adam lists the descendants of Adam from Seth to Noah with their ages at the birth of their first sons (except Adam himself for whom his age at the birth of Seth his third son is given) and their ages at death (Adam lives 930 years). The chapter notes that Adam had other sons and daughters after Seth but does not name them.

<h3><span id=""Body"">Body</span></h3>
<p>According to jewish literature
Adam possessed a body of light identical to the light created by God on the first day. According to Jewish mystical tradition the original glory of Adam can be regained through mystical contemplation of God.</p>
<h3><span id=""Adam.2C_Lilith_and_Eve""></span><span id=""Adam_Lilith_and_Eve"">Adam Lilith and Eve</span></h3>
<p>The rabbis puzzled by the verse of Genesis 1 which states that God created man and woman together told that when God created Adam he also created a woman from the dust as he had created Adam and named her Lilith; but the two could not agree for Adam wanted Lilith to lie under him and Lilith insisted that Adam should lie under her and so she fled from him and Eve was created from Adam's rib. Her story was greatly developed during the Middle Ages in the tradition of Aggadic midrashim the Zohar and Jewish mysticism. Other rabbis explained the same verse as meaning that Adam was created with two faces male and female or as a single hermaphrodite being male and female joined back to back but God saw that this made walking and conversing difficult and so split them apart.</p>
<h3><span id=""Eve.27s_fault_in_the_Fall""></span><span id=""Eve's_fault_in_the_Fall"">Eve's fault in the Fall</span></h3>
<p>The serpent approached Eve rather than Adam because Adam had heard the word of God with his own ears whereas Eve had only his report; Eve tasted the fruit and knew at once that she was doomed to death and said to herself that it was better she trick Adam into eating so that he too would die and not take another woman in her place. Adam ate the fruit unaware of what he was doing and was filled with grief. When Adam blamed Eve after eating the forbidden fruit God rebuked him that Adam as a man should not have obeyed his wife for he is the head not her.</p>
<h3><span id=""Children_of_Adam_and_Eve"">Children of Adam and Eve</span></h3>
<p>Adam withdrew from Eve for 130 years after their expulsion from Eden and in this time both he and Eve had sex with demons until at length they reunited and Eve gave birth to Seth. A 2nd-century BCE Jewish religious work the Book of Jubilees tells how Adam had a daughter Awân born after Cain and Abel and another daughter Azûrâ born after Seth and they had nine other sons; Cain married Awân and Seth married Azûrâ thus accounting for their descendants. The <i>Life of Adam and Eve</i> and its Greek version the <i>Apocalypse of Moses</i> recount how Adam repented his sin in exile and was rewarded by being transported to the heavenly paradise foreshadowing the destiny of all the righteous at the end of time.</p>
<h3><span id=""Adam.27s_death_and_burial""></span><span id=""Adam's_death_and_burial"">Adam's death and burial</span></h3>
<p>The Archangel Michael attended Adam's death together with Eve and his son Seth still living at that time and he was buried together with his murdered son Abel. Because they repented God gave Adam and Eve garments of light and similar garments will clothe the Messiah when he comes.</p><p>According to the Apocalypse of Moses which probably originates in first-century CE Jewish literature the altar of the Temple of Solomon was the centre of the world and the gateway to God's Garden of Eden and it was here that Adam was both created and buried.</p>
<h3><span id=""Attitude_towards_Adam"">Attitude towards Adam</span></h3>
<p>In the 17th-century book Kav ha-Yashar the author warns not to talk negatively about Adam and writes that those who talk positively about Adam will be blessed with a long life. A similar warning can be found in The Zohar.</p>
<h3><span id=""Adam_and_the_angel_Raziel"">Adam and the angel Raziel</span></h3>
<p>The Sefer Raziel HaMalakh (רזיאל המלאך) (<i>Raziel the Angel</i>) is a collection of esoteric writings probably compiled and edited by the same hand but originally not the work of one author which according to tradition was revealed to Adam by the angel Raziel. The book cannot be shown to predate the 13th century but may in parts date back to Late Antiquity and like other obscure ancient texts such as the Bahir and <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> it has been extant in a number of versions. Zunz (""G. V."" 2d ed. p. 176) distinguishes three main parts: (1) the Book Ha-Malbush; (2) the Great Raziel; (3) the Book of Secrets or the Book of Noah. These three parts are still distinguishable—2b–7a 7b–33b 34a and b. After these follow two shorter parts entitled ""Creation"" and ""Shi'ur Ḳomah"" and after 41a come formulas for amulets and incantations.</p>
<h2><span id=""In_Christianity"">In Christianity</span></h2>

<h3><span id=""Original_sin"">Original sin</span></h3>
<p>The idea of original sin is not found in Judaism nor in Islam and was introduced into Christianity by the Apostle Paul drawing on currents in Hellenistic Jewish thought which held that Adam's sin had introduced death and sin into the world. Sin for Paul was a power to which all humans are subject but Christ's coming held out the means by which the righteous would be restored to the Paradise from which Adam's sin had banished mankind. He did not conceive of this original sin of Adam as being biologically transmitted or that later generations were to be punished for the deeds of a remote ancestor. It was Augustine who took this step locating sin itself in male semen: when Adam and Eve ate of the fruit they were ashamed and covered their genitals identifying the place from which the first sin was passed on to all succeeding generations. Only Jesus Christ who was not conceived by human semen was free of the stain passed down from Adam. (Augustine's idea was based on the ancient world's ideas on biology according to which male sperm contained the entire unborn baby the mother's womb being no more than a nurturing chamber in which it grew.)</p>
<h3><span id=""Adam.27s_grave:_Golgotha_replaces_Solomon.27s_Temple""></span><span id=""Adam's_grave:_Golgotha_replaces_Solomon's_Temple"">Adam's grave: Golgotha replaces Solomon's Temple</span></h3>
<p>As mentioned above the Apocalypse of Moses a Jewish writing containing material probably originating from the first century CE places both Adam's place of creation and his burial at the altar of the Temple of Solomon seen as the centre of the world and the gateway to the Garden of Eden. The early Christian community adapted this to their own legend of Golgotha replacing the altar with the place of Jesus's crucifixion. According to this Christian legend current in the time of Origen (early 3rd century CE) the holy blood of Christ trickled down and restored to life the father of the human race who then led the saints who appeared to many in Jerusalem on that day as described in Scripture.</p>
<h2><span id=""In_Islam"">In Islam</span></h2>


<p>In Islam God created Adam (Arabic: <b>آدم</b>) from a handful of earth taken from the entire world which explains why the peoples of the world are of different colours. According to the Islamic creation myth he was the first prophet of Islam and the first Muslim. The Quran says that all the prophets preached the same faith of submission to God. When God informed the angels that he would create a vice-regent (a <i>khalifa</i>) on Earth the angels enquired saying ""will You place therein such that will spread corruption and bloodshed?"" So God showed the angels saying ""Tell Me the names of these?"" The angels had no knowledge of these as God had not taught them. Then God allowed Adam to reveal these names to them saying ""Did I not say to you (angels) that I know what is unseen in the heavens and the earth and I know what you (angels) reveal and what you (Satan) conceal;"" the scholar Al-Tabari explained that God was referring to Iblis (Satan) of his evil plans and to the angels of their honesty.</p><p>Adam and Eve both ate of the Tree of Immortality and both shared guilt equally for Eve neither tempted Adam or ate before him; nor is Eve to blame for the pain of childbirth for God never punishes one person for the sins of another. The Shia school of Islam does not even consider that their action was a sin for obedience and disobedience are possible only on Earth and not in heaven where the paradise is located.</p><p>Adam fell on a mountain in India the tallest in the world and so the closest to Heaven and from there God sent him to Mecca where he repented and was forgiven. At Mecca he built the first Sanctuary (the Kaabah - it was later rebuilt by Ibrahim) and was taught the ritual of the Hajj and wove the first cloak for himself and the first veil and shift for Eve and after this returned to India where he died at the age of 930 having seen the sons of the sons of his children 1400 in all.</p><p>According to the Ahmadiyya sect Adam was not the first human being on earth but when the human race came into existence and spread all over the world and developed the ability to receive revelation God sent Adam to each and every branch of civilization. According to a revelation received by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad the founder of the community the Adam mentioned in the Quran was born 4598 years before Muhammad.</p><p>In the Quran Adam is given the name by God known as the (Adam-I-Safi) or The Chosen One.</p>

Battle_of_Nihriya|"The Battle of Niḫriya was the culminating point of the hostilities between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni.
When Hittite king Šuppiluliuma I (r. c. 1344–1322 BC) conquered Mitanni he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish) and distributed the large part of territories of this kingdom between his allies. The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called Ḫanigalbat. During the reign of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Urḫi-Tešub) Ḫanigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates. When Ḫattusili III ousted his nephew Urḫi-Tešub and seized the Hittite throne he had to be content with the permanent loss of Ḫanigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a Hittite vassal state.
The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared I and precipitated a crisis..."|1
Air_raids_on_Japan|"Allied forces conducted many air raids on Japan during World War II causing extensive destruction to the country's cities and killing between 241000 and 900000 people. During the first years of the Pacific War these attacks were limited to the Doolittle Raid in April 1942 and small-scale raids on military positions in the Kuril Islands from mid-1943. Strategic bombing raids began in June 1944 and continued until the end of the war in August 1945. Allied naval and land-based tactical air units also attacked Japan during 1945.
The United States military air campaign waged against Japan began in earnest in mid-1944 and intensified during the war's last months. While plans for attacks on Japan had been prepared prior to the Pacific War these could not begin until the long-range B-29 Superfortress bomber was ready for combat. From June 1944 until January 1945 B-29s stationed in India staged through bases in China to make a series of nine raids on targets in western Japan but this effort..."|1

Bombing_of_Treviso_in_World_War_II|"The bombing of Treviso a town in Northeastern Italy took place on 7 April 1944 during World War II. Aimed at disabling the town's marshalling yard it resulted in the destruction of most of the town.


== History ==
Treviso a town of 60000 inhabitants located in the Veneto region thirty kilometres north of Venice was in a strategically important position for railway communications in northeastern Italy and was therefore bombed several times by the Allied air forces.
The first and most devastating raid took place on 7 April 1944. 159 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress of the United States Army Air Force (escorted by Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighters) dropped over 2000 bombs (446 metric tons of ordnance) during an attack which lasted five minutes (from 1.24 PM to 1.29 PM); the target was the local marshalling yard but the inaccuracy of the bombing caused most of the bombs to fall all over the city destroying most of it.

Jean-Auguste-Dominique_Ingres|"Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres ( ANG-grə French: [ʒɑ̃n‿oɡyst dɔminik ɛ̃ɡʁ]; 29 August 1780 – 14 January 1867) was a French Neoclassical painter. Ingres was profoundly influenced by past artistic traditions and aspired to become the guardian of academic orthodoxy against the ascendant Romantic style. Although he considered himself a painter of history in the tradition of Nicolas Poussin and Jacques-Louis David it is his portraits both painted and drawn that are recognized as his greatest legacy. His expressive distortions of form and space made him an important precursor of modern art influencing Picasso Matisse and other modernists.
Born into a modest family in Montauban he travelled to Paris to study in the studio of David. In 1802 he made his Salon debut and won the Prix de Rome for his painting The Ambassadors of Agamemnon in the tent of Achilles. By the time he departed in 1806 for his residency in Rome his style—revealing his close study of Italian and Flemish Renaissance masters..."|0
Termite|"Termites are eusocial insects that are classified at the taxonomic rank of infraorder Isoptera or as epifamily Termitoidae within the order Blattodea (along with cockroaches). Termites were once classified in a separate order from cockroaches but recent phylogenetic studies indicate that they evolved from cockroaches as sister to Cryptocercus. Previous estimates suggested the divergence took place during the Jurassic or Triassic however more recent estimates suggest they have an origin during the early Cretaceous with the first fossil records in the mid Cretaceous. About 3106 species are currently described with a few hundred more left to be described. Although these insects are often called ""white ants"" they are not ants and are not closely related to ants.
Like ants and some bees and wasps from the separate order Hymenoptera termites divide as ""workers"" and ""soldiers"" that are usually sterile. All colonies have fertile males called ""kings"" and one or more fertile females called..."|0
Porcupine|"Porcupines are large rodents with coats of sharp and pointy spines or quills that protect them against predators. The term covers two families of animals: the Old World porcupines of family Hystricidae and the New World porcupines of family Erethizontidae. Both families belong to the infraorder Hystricognathi within the profoundly diverse order Rodentia and display superficially similar coats of quills: despite this the two groups are distinct from each other and are not closely related to each other within the Hystricognathi.
The Old World porcupines live in southern Europe Asia (western and southern) and most of Africa. They are large terrestrial and strictly nocturnal. In taxonomic terms they form the family Hystricidae.
The New World porcupines are indigenous to North America and northern South America. They live in wooded areas and can climb trees where some species spend their entire lives. They are less strictly nocturnal than their Old World relatives and generally smaller..."|0

Siege_of_Svetigrad_(1448)|"The Siege of Svetigrad began on 14 May 1448 when an Ottoman army led by Sultan Murad II besieged the fortress of Svetigrad (now Kodžadžik). After the many failed Ottoman expeditions into Albania against the League of Lezhë a confederation of Albanian Principalities created in 1444 and headed by Skanderbeg Murad II decided to march an army into Skanderbeg's dominions in order to capture the key Albanian fortress of Svetigrad. The fortress lay on an important route between present-day North Macedonia and Albania and thus its occupation would give the Ottomans easy access into Albania. The force prepared by Murad was the largest force with which the Ottomans had ever attacked Skanderbeg. Murad planned to take the fortress march into the Albanian interior and capture the main citadel of Krujë thus crushing the Albanian League.
At the same time Skanderbeg had been at war with Venice. Realizing the magnitude of his challenge Skanderbeg attempted to relieve the garrison by engaging in..."|1
Ragamuffin_War|"The Ragamuffin War (Portuguese: Guerra dos Farrapos or more commonly Revolução Farroupilha) was a Republican uprising that began in southern Brazil in the province (currently state) of Rio Grande do Sul in 1835. The rebels led by generals Bento Gonçalves da Silva and Antônio de Sousa Neto with the support of the Italian fighter Giuseppe Garibaldi surrendered to imperial forces in 1845.It is considered the longest and third bloodiest of the failed wars of secession in the Brazilian Empire after the Cabanagem Revolt and Balaiada Revolt.


== History ==


=== Beginning of the war ===
The uprising is believed to have begun due to the difference between the economy of Rio Grande do Sul and the rest of the country. Unlike the other provinces the economy of Rio Grande do Sul focused on the internal market rather than exporting commodities. The province's main product charque (dried and salted beef) suffered badly from competition from charque imported from Uruguay and Argentina. The people that..."|1

However for reasons yet unclear the Tsugaru backed out of the alliance and re-joined the imperial cause after a..."|1
Operation_Wunderland|"Operation Wunderland (German: Unternehmen Wunderland) comprised a large-scale operation undertaken in summer 1942 by the German Kriegsmarine in the waters of the Northern Sea Route close to the Arctic Ocean. The Germans knew that many ships of the Soviet Navy had sought refuge in the Kara Sea because of the protection that its ice pack provided during 10 months of the year.

French_and_Indian_War|"The French and Indian War (1754–1763) pitted the colonies of British America against those of New France each side supported by military units from the parent country and by Native American allies. At the start of the war the French colonies had a population of roughly 60000 settlers compared with 2 million in the British colonies. The outnumbered French particularly depended on the natives.
The European nations declared a wider war upon one another overseas in 1756 two years into the French and Indian War and some view the French and Indian War as being merely the American theater of the worldwide Seven Years' War of 1756–63; however the French and Indian War is viewed in the United States as a singular conflict which was not associated with any European war.

Louse|"Louse (plural: lice) is the common name for members of the order Phthiraptera which contains nearly 5000 species of wingless insect. Lice are obligate parasites living externally on warm-blooded hosts which include every species of bird and mammal except for monotremes pangolins and bats. Lice are vectors of diseases such as typhus.
Chewing lice live among the hairs or feathers of their host and feed on skin and debris while sucking lice pierce the host's skin and feed on blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole life on a single host cementing their eggs called nits to hairs or feathers. The eggs hatch into nymphs which moult three times before becoming fully grown a process that takes about four weeks.
Humans host two species of louse—the head louse and the body louse are subspecies of Pediculus humanus; and the pubic louse Pthirus pubis. The body louse has the smallest genome of any known insect; it has been used as a model organism and has been the subject..."|0

Aceh_War|"The Aceh War (Indonesian: Perang Aceh) also known as the Dutch War or the Infidel War (1873–1904) was an armed military conflict between the Sultanate of Aceh and the Kingdom of the Netherlands which was triggered by discussions between representatives of Aceh and the United States in Singapore during early 1873. The war was part of a series of conflicts in the late 19th century that consolidated Dutch rule over modern-day Indonesia.
The campaign drew controversy in the Netherlands as photographs and accounts of the death toll were reported. Isolated bloody insurgencies continued as late as 1914 and less violent forms of Acehnese resistance continued to persist until World War II and the Japanese occupation.

== Background ==
Upon the death of Margaret Maid of Norway in late September 1290 there arose a number of claimants to the throne of Scotland. The Guardians of Scotland were the de facto heads of state until a king was chosen. The late king Alexander III had been married to Margaret of England sister to Edward I and he was asked to conduct the court proceedings in the dispute though not to arbitrate; the decision was to be made by a jury of 104 ""auditors"".John Balliol a descendant of King David I was chosen and was inaugurated at Scone on St. Andrew's Day 30 November 1292. Edward I treated Scotland as a feudal vassal state claiming contributions towards the cost of the defence of England. When he demanded military support for his war against France the Scots responded by forming an alliance with the French and launched an unsuccessful attack on Carlisle.

Operation_Eagle's_Summit|"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">
</p>

<p><b>Operation Eagle</b> (Arabic: <span lang=""ar"" dir=""rtl"">عملية نسر</span>‎) was an Egyptian military campaign in the Sinai Peninsula that was launched in August 2011 to confront the Sinai insurgency. The campaign was aimed against Islamist insurgents who had been attacking the Egyptian security forces in the Sinai and using the area as a base from which to attack Israel since early 2011. Successive Egyptian operation against insurgents in 2012 named Operation Sinai was initially referred as the second part of Operation Eagle. It was the first in a number of campaigns to retake the Sinai from insurgents that lasts to this day.

<h2><span id=""Background"">Background</span></h2>
<h3><span id=""Historic_perspective"">Historic perspective</span></h3>
<p>Sinai was an integral part of Egypt since the inception of the Muhammad Ali dynasty in the early 19th century. Israel briefly captured the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day War. As part of the 1979 Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty in 1982 Israel withdrew from the peninsula. Among the treaty's other provisions was an agreement that the peninsula would be left effectively demilitarized.</p><p>A number of factors have enabled armed Islamist groups to take root and proliferate in the Sinai. Including local population alienation from the state and becoming more dependent on smuggling to Gaza.</p>
<h3><span id=""Early_Islamist_attacks"">Early Islamist attacks</span></h3>

<p>The security situation in the Sinai began deteriorating early in 2011 as a fallout of the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Since February to August of that year the Egypt–Israel pipeline in El-Arish was attacked five times by saboteurs.</p><p>On 30 July militants staged an attack on an Egyptian police station in El-Arish killing six.</p><p>On 2 August a group claiming to be the Sinai wing of Al-Qaeda declared its intention to create an Islamic caliphate in the Sinai.</p>
<h2><span id=""Operation"">Operation</span></h2>

<p>After working out arrangement with the Israeli government to permit more forces in the Sinai Peninsula than is allowed for by the security annex of the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty. SCAF launched Operation Eagle on 14–15 August 2011.
</p><p>Egypt deployed 2500 troops and 250 armored personnel carriers including two special forces brigades tanks and Apache helicopters in key locations in North Sinai with armored personnel carriers operating around al Arish Rafah and Shaykh Zuweid. The move marked the first time Egypt has deployed military forces on such a scale since its treaty with Israel. The objectives of the operation are to confront Islamist insurgents and criminal gangs threatening Egypt's national security and to restore law and order.</p>
<p>On 15 August Egyptian security forces swept through a house known to be used by five leading Islamist figures. One of the five was killed; the remaining four were taken into custody.</p><p>On 16 August a group of gunmen believed to be affiliated with jihadist movements attacked an Egyptian army checkpoint. Egypt's forces suffered no casualties in the assault.</p><p>On 17 August two Bedouins were killed in southern Sinai. Their families blamed Egyptian police for their deaths but the police said it was not involved in the incident.</p><p>On 18 August a coordinated attack was staged upon Israeli military and civilians from Sinai resulting in 6 Israeli civilians and two soldiers and 5 Egyptian soldiers killed as well as 10 attackers.
</p><p>On 26 August then Israeli defense minister Ehud Barak said that Israel will agree for Egypt to employ thousands of troops in the Sinai.</p>
<h2><span id=""Aftermath"">Aftermath</span></h2>

<p>Following the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack forces from Egypt’s army and the police engaged in an operation against armed men who have been targeting security personnel in North Sinai.  A number of clashes between armed men and security forces at several security checkpoints in the Sinai occurred during this time. Initially the press related to the 2012 operation as the continuation of Operation Eagle though later turning to an Egyptian official name Operation Sinai (2012).
</p><p>Egyptian security sources have said that over 2000 Islamic militants reside in the Sinai region.  The military said that the goal of the operation is to ""restore security by pursuing and targeting armed terrorist elements in Sinai.""</p>
<h2><span id=""Reactions"">Reactions</span></h2>
<h3><span id=""Israel"">Israel</span></h3>
<p>The 1979 Camp David Accords which established peace between Egypt and Israel mandates that the Sinai must remain demilitarized.
</p><p>During the beginning of the operation in 2011 Israel allowed the deployment of thousands of troops in the Sinai with helicopters and armored vehicles but not tanks.</p><p>During the beginning of August 2012 when Operation Eagle intensified Israel approved a request from Barak to allow Egypt to deploy attack helicopters in the Sinai.</p><p>However concern began to be raised as Egypt began deploying more force and tanks without coordination from Israel. On 21 August Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman said that it is important for Israel to make sure that the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty is upheld and not to remain silent as Egyptian military forces enter the Sinai. Concern was raised by Israeli officials over Egyptian failure to notify Israel about the deployment of tanks in the Sinai which violates the peace treaty. Lieberman said ""We must make sure that every detail is upheld otherwise we'll find ourselves in a slippery slope as far as the peace treaty is concerned.""</p><p>On the same day Israeli daily <i>Maariv</i> reported that Israel sent a message to Egypt via the White House protesting Egypt's ongoing increase in military presence in the Sinai without coordination from Israel and telling Egypt that it must remove tanks from the Sinai because their presence violates the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty of 1979 which states that Sinai Peninsula is to remain demilitarized. The Israeli daily <i>Maariv</i> reported was reinforced by an article in <i>The New York Times</i> which stated that Israel was “troubled” by the entry of Egyptian tanks into the northern Sinai Peninsula without coordination with Israel and had asked Egypt to withdraw them. Partly due to Egypt's military deploying tanks in the Sinai Peninsula Israel is increasingly worried about what has long been their most critical regional relationship. The lack of coordination around their deployment is seen as potentially undermining a peace treaty that has been a cornerstone of Israel’s security for decades according to the New York Times. Israel is also concerned that Egypt may use Operation Eagle to build up its military presence in the Sinai and leave the tanks and armored carriers in the Sinai while not doing much more than symbolic action to eliminate the terrorist threat.</p><p>Israel has not issued a formal complaint and instead prefers to resolve the issue through quiet contacts as well as mediation from the U.S. to avoid straining its relationship with Egypt.</p><p>On 24 August 2012 a senior Egyptian military source said that Egyptian Defense Minister Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak have reached an agreement on the issue of the militarization of the Sinai.  <i>Al Hayat</i> reported that Sissi phoned Barak and said that Egypt was committed to maintaining the peace treaty with Israel.  Sissi also said that the militarization was temporary and is needed for security and to fight terrorism.  However an Israeli defense official denied that such a conversation took place.</p><p>In late August 2012 then Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi said that the security operations do not threaten anyone and ""there should not be any kind of international or regional concerns at all from the presence of Egyptian security forces"". Morsi added that the campaign was in  ""full respect to international treaties"". The Egyptian-Israeli peace deal places limits on Egyptian military deployment in the Sinai. Officials in Israel were concerned about Egypt building up heavy armour in Sinai.</p><p>On 8 September an Israeli official confirmed that coordination exists between Israel and Egypt regarding Operation Eagle. Egyptian Military spokesman Ahmed Mohammed Ali had earlier announced that Egypt has been consulting with Israel regarding its security measures in the Sinai.</p>
<h3><span id=""United_States"">United States</span></h3>
<p>According to CNN in a move to increase security in the Sinai help Morsi and reassure Israel U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta offered Egypt classified intelligence-sharing capabilities to help Egypt identify military threats in the area which he discussed during his recent trips to Egypt and Israel.  The technology has been widely used in Iraq and Afghanistan to identify vehicles at great distances. The technology may also be used by the Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai.  The United States is also offering increased intelligence sharing including satellite imagery and drone flights as well as cellphone intercepts and other communications among militants suspected of plotting attacks.</p><p>On 22 August the State Department urged Egypt to be transparent over Operation Eagle and any security operations in the Sinai.  The State Department said that the United States supports Operation Eagle against terrorism but stressed that Egypt must continue coordination with Israel regarding these operations and military increases in the Sinai according to the 1979 Camp David Accords.   The State Department also called on Egypt to fulfill its obligations under the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and deal strongly with security threats in the Sinai while ensuring that ""lines of communication stay open.""</p><p>On 23 August then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaking with Egyptian foreign minister Mohamed Kamel Amr urged Amr to maintain lines of communication with Israel and emphasized the importance of being transparent over the militarization of the Sinai.</p>
<h3><span id=""Multinational_Force_and_Observers_in_Sinai"">Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai</span></h3>
<p>The Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai a 1650-strong international organization created in 1979 during the Camp David Accords with peacekeeping responsibilities kept a low profile during the intensification of Operation Eagle in 2012.

The vetulicolian body comprises two parts: a voluminous anterior forebody tipped with an anteriorly positioned mouth and lined with a row of five round to oval-shaped features on each lateral side which have been interpreted as gills (or at least openings in the vicinity of the pharynx); and a posterior section that primitively comprises seven segments and functions as a tail. All vetulicolians lack preserved appendages of any kind having no legs feelers or even eyes. The area where the anterior and posterior parts join is constricted.Their affinity has been uncertain; they have been considered to represent stem- and crown-group arthropods stem-group vertebrates and early deuterostomes.

Mule|"A mule is the offspring of a male donkey (jack) and a female horse (mare). Horses and donkeys are different species with different numbers of chromosomes. Of the two first generation hybrids between these two species a mule is easier to obtain than a hinny which is the offspring of a female donkey (jenny) and a male horse (stallion).
The size of a mule and work to which it is put depend largely on the breeding of the mule's female parent (dam). Mules can be lightweight medium weight or when produced from draft horse mares of moderately heavy weight. Mules are reputed to be more patient hardy and long-lived than horses and are described as less obstinate and more intelligent than donkeys.

Duck|"Duck is the common name for numerous species in the waterfowl family Anatidae which also includes swans and geese. Ducks are divided among several subfamilies in the family Anatidae; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species) but a form taxon since swans and geese are not considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds mostly smaller than the swans and geese and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.
Ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms such as loons or divers grebes gallinules and coots.


== Etymology ==

 The word duck comes from Old English *dūce ""diver"" a derivative of the verb *dūcan ""to duck bend down low as if to get under something or dive"" because of the way many species in the dabbling duck group feed by upending; compare with Dutch duiken and German tauchen ""to dive"".

Perlite|"Perlite is an amorphous volcanic glass that has a relatively high water content typically formed by the hydration of obsidian.  It occurs naturally and has the unusual property of greatly expanding when heated sufficiently. It is an industrial mineral and a commercial product useful for its low density after processing. 


== Properties ==

Perlite softens when it reaches temperatures of 850–900 °C (1560–1650 °F). Water trapped in the structure of the material vaporises and escapes and this causes the expansion of the material to 7–16 times its original volume. The expanded material is a brilliant white due to the reflectivity of the trapped bubbles. Unexpanded (""raw"") perlite has a bulk density around 1100 kg/m3 (1.1 g/cm3) while typical expanded perlite has a bulk density of about 30–150 kg/m3 (0.03–0.150 g/cm3).

Vulture|A vulture is a scavenging bird of prey. The New World vultures include the California condor and the Andean condor; the Old World vultures include the birds that are seen scavenging on carcasses of dead animals on African plains. Some traditional Old World vultures (including the bearded vulture) are not closely related to the others which is why the vultures are to be subdivided into three taxa rather than two. New World vultures are found in North and South America; Old World vultures are native to Europe Africa and Asia meaning that between the two groups vultures are found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica (though Trigonoceps vultures have crossed the Wallace line).A particular characteristic of many vultures is a bald head devoid of normal feathers. Although it has been historically believed to help keep the head clean when feeding the bare skin may play an important role in thermoregulation.

It was also the last of the great military triumphs of Nader Shah. The battle was in fact fought over a period of ten days in which the first day saw the Ottomans routed from the field followed by a series of subsequent blockades and pursuits until the final destruction of the Ottoman army. The severity of the defeat in conjunction with the debacle near Mosul ended any hopes Istanbul had entertained for a military victory in the war and forced them to enter negotiations with a significantly weaker position than they would otherwise have occupied.

Franco-Prussian_War|The Franco-Prussian War or Franco-German War often referred to in France as the War of 1870 was a conflict between the Second French Empire (and later the Third French Republic) and the German states of the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia. Lasting from 19 July 1870 to 28 January 1871 the conflict was caused primarily by France's determination to restore its dominant position in continental Europe which it had lost following Prussia's crushing victory over Austria in 1866. According to some historians Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck deliberately provoked the French into declaring war on Prussia in order to draw four independent southern German states—Baden Württemberg Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadt—into an alliance with the North German Confederation dominated by Prussia. Some historians contend that Bismarck exploited the circumstances as they unfolded. None however dispute the fact that Bismarck must have recognized the potential for new German alliances...|1
Candiru|"Candiru (Vandellia cirrhosa) also known as cañero toothpick fish or vampire fish is a species of parasitic freshwater catfish in the family Trichomycteridae native to the Amazon Basin where it is found in the countries of Bolivia Brazil Colombia Ecuador and Peru.
The definition of candiru differs between authors. The word has been used to refer to only Vandellia cirrhosa the entire genus Vandellia the subfamily Vandelliinae or even the two subfamilies Vandelliinae and Stegophilinae.Although some candiru species have been known to grow to a size of 40 centimetres (16 in) in length others are considerably smaller. These smaller species are known for an alleged tendency to invade and parasitise the human urethra; however despite ethnological reports dating back to the late 19th century the first documented case of the removal of a candiru from a human urethra did not occur until 1997 and even that incident has remained a matter of controversy.

Battle_of_Gemmano|"The Battle of Gemmano took place during World War II between the dates of September 4th and September 15th of 1944. The battle occurred in the area of the Gothic Line near the Apennine Mountains in northern Italy which would soon turn out to be the last line of defense for the Axis Powers in Italy. The village of Gemmano was eventually captured on September 9th 1944 by the invading Eighth Army (United Kingdom) but two more subsequent attacks were needed to secure the area surrounding the village of Gemmano.

Action_of_7_April_1800|"The Action of 7 April 1800 was a minor naval engagement fought between a British squadron blockading the Spanish naval base of Cádiz and a convoy of 13 Spanish merchant vessels escorted by three frigates bound for the Spanish colonies in the Americas. The blockade squadron consisted of the ships of the line HMS Leviathan and HMS Swiftsure and the frigate HMS Emerald commanded by Rear-Admiral John Thomas Duckworth on Leviathan. The Spanish convoy sailed from Cádiz on 3 April 1800 and encountered Duckworth's squadron two days later. The Spanish attempted to escape; Emerald succeeded in capturing one ship early on 6 April. The British captured a brig the following morning and the British squadron divided in pursuit of the remainder.

Potato_cyst_nematode|"Potato root nematodes or potato cyst nematodes (PCN) are 1-mm long roundworms belonging to the genus Globodera which comprises around 12 species. They live on the roots of plants of the family Solanaceae such as potatoes and tomatoes. PCN cause growth retardation and at very high population densities damage to the roots and early senescence of plants. The nematode is not indigenous to Europe but originates from the Andes. Fields are free from PCN until an introduction occurs after which the typical patches or hotspots occur on the farmland. These patches can become full field infestations when unchecked. Yield reductions can average up to 60% at high population densities.

It is a demersal fish native to marine or brackish waters of the Northeast Atlantic Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. It is an important food fish. Turbot in the Black Sea have often been included in this species but are now generally regarded as separate the Black Sea turbot or kalkan (S. maeoticus). True turbot are not found in the Northwest Atlantic; the ""turbot"" of that region which was involved in the so-called ""Turbot War"" between Canada and Spain is the Greenland halibut or Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides).

Heliconiinae|"The Heliconiinae commonly called heliconians or longwings are a subfamily of the brush-footed butterflies (family Nymphalidae). They can be divided into 45–50 genera and were sometimes treated as a separate family Heliconiidae within the Papilionoidea. The colouration is predominantly reddish and black and though of varying wing shape the forewings are always elongated tipwards hence the common name.
Most longwings are found in the Tropics particularly in South America; only the Argynnini are quite diverse in the Holarctic. Especially tropical species feed on poisonous plants characteristically Passifloraceae vines as larvae becoming poisonous themselves. The adult butterflies announce their acquired toxicity with strong aposematic colours warning off would-be predators. There are several famous cases of Batesian and Müllerian mimicry both within this group and with other butterflies.

Permit_(fish)|"The permit (Trachinotus falcatus) is a game fish of the western Atlantic Ocean belonging to the family Carangidae. Adults feed on crabs shrimp and smaller fish. 


== Taxonomy ==
The permit was first described by the ""father of taxonomy"" Carl Linnaeus in his tenth edition of the work Systema Naturae which was published in 1758. He originally classified it as Labrus falcatus though the fish has since been placed in the genus Trachinotus. It is the type species of the genus Trachinotus.


== Etymology ==
The permit's genus name Trachinotus comes from a fusion of the Greek words trachys (τραχύς) which means ""rough"" and noton (νῶτον) meaning ""back"". The species name for the permit falcatus is a Latin adjective which roughly means ""armed with scythes"". This serves as a reference to the permit's dorsal fin that occasionally protrudes from the water when schools of permit feed near the surface.

Following the Race to the Sea both sides dug in along a meandering line of fortified trenches stretching from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier with France which changed little except during early 1917 and in 1918.
Between 1915 and 1917 there were several offensives along this front. The attacks employed massive artillery bombardments and massed infantry advances.

Adriaen_de_Vries|"Adriaen de Vries (c.1556–1626) was a Northern Mannerist sculptor born in the Netherlands but working in Central Europe whose international style crossed the threshold to the Baroque; he excelled in refined modelling and bronze casting and in the manipulation of patina and became the most famous European sculptor of his generation. He also excelled in draughtsmanship.
Partly as a result of the disturbances of the Thirty Years' War and also changes in style Adriaen de Vries had no direct follower.


== Life ==
Born in The Hague to a patrician family his early training is obscure; a recent suggestion suggests an apprenticeship with Willem Danielsz. van Tetrode known in Italy as Guglielmo Fiammingo a pupil of Benvenuto Cellini who had returned to the Netherlands. Another possibility is that he was apprenticed to a goldsmith his brother-in-law Simon Adriaensz Rottermont.

Toad|"Toad is a common name for certain frogs especially of the family Bufonidae that are characterized by dry leathery skin short legs and large bumps covering the parotoid glands.A distinction between frogs and toads is not made in scientific taxonomy but is common in popular culture (folk taxonomy) in which toads are associated with drier rougher skin and more terrestrial habitats.


== Biology ==
In scientific taxonomy toads are found in the families Bufonidae Bombinatoridae Calyptocephalellidae Discoglossidae Myobatrachidae Pelobatidae Rhinophrynidae Scaphiopodidae and Microhylidae.Usually the largest of the bumps on the skin of a toad are those that cover the parotoid glands. The bumps are commonly called warts but they have nothing to do with pathologic warts being fixed in size present on healthy specimens and not caused by infection.
Toads travel from non-breeding to breeding areas of ponds and lakes. Bogert (1947) suggests that the toads' call is the most important..."|0

The_Troubles|"The Troubles (Irish: Na Trioblóidí) was an ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century. Also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict it is sometimes described as an ""irregular war"" or ""low-level war"". The conflict began in the late 1960s and is usually deemed to have ended with the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Although the Troubles primarily took place in Northern Ireland at times the violence spilled over into parts of the Republic of Ireland England and mainland Europe.
The conflict was primarily political and nationalistic fuelled by historical events. It also had an ethnic or sectarian dimension but despite the use of the terms ""Protestant"" and ""Catholic"" to refer to the two sides it was not a religious conflict. A key issue was the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. Unionists who were mostly Ulster Protestants wanted Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom.

Hare|"Hares and jackrabbits are leporids belonging to the genus Lepus. Hares are classified in the same family as rabbits. They are similar in size and form to rabbits and have similar herbivorous diets but generally have longer ears and live solitarily or in pairs. Also unlike rabbits their young are able to fend for themselves shortly after birth rather than emerging blind and helpless. Most are fast runners. Hare species are native to Africa Eurasia and North America.
Five leporid species with ""hare"" in their common names are not considered true hares: the hispid hare (Caprolagus hispidus) and four species known as red rock hares (comprising Pronolagus). Conversely jackrabbits are hares rather than rabbits.
A hare less than one year old is called a leveret. A group of hares is called a ""drove"".

It took place on 4 August 1737 near the Bosnian town of Banja Luka. The Bosnian population was aware that Austrian forces would invade Bosnia during the war; to be exact the energetic Bosnian vizier Hekimoğlu Ali Pasha predicted in 1737 that without a declaration of war a large Austrian army of over 14000 soldiers would attack Bosnia. That's why he called a meeting in Travnik with the Bosnian captains and ayans to plan the defense. At this council all captains and ayans above all ultimately demanded that all preparations for defense be carried out immediately without the knowledge and consent of Porte; thus the Ottoman forces were planning the defense without the help of Istanbul. Vizier declared a defense in the territory of Bosnia and quickly gathered about 10000 soldiers in the grassland. All captains in the...|1

Strepsiptera|"The Strepsiptera are an endopterygote order of insects with nine extant families that include about 600 described species. They are endoparasites in other insects such as bees wasps leafhoppers silverfish and cockroaches. Females of most species never emerge from the host after entering its body finally dying inside it. The early-stage larvae do emerge because they must find an unoccupied living host and the short-lived males must emerge to seek a receptive female in her host. They are believed to be most closely related to beetles from which they diverged 300-350 million years ago but do not appear in the fossil record until the Mid-Cretaceous around 100 million years ago.The order is not well known to non-specialists and the nearest they have to a common name is ""stylops"".

<p><b>Zhuge Liang</b> (<span>pronunciation in PRC Standard Mandarin:</span> <span>[ʈʂú.kɤ̀ ljâŋ]</span> <span>(<span><span><span></span>listen</span></span>)</span>; 181–234) courtesy name <b>Kongming</b> was a Chinese politician military strategist writer engineer and inventor. He served as the chancellor and regent of the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period. He is recognised as the most accomplished strategist of his era and has been compared to Sun Tzu the author of <i>The Art of War</i>. His reputation as an intelligent and learned scholar grew even while he was living in relative seclusion earning him the nickname ""Wolong"" or ""Fulong"" meaning ""Crouching Dragon"" or ""Sleeping Dragon"". Zhuge Liang is often depicted wearing a Taoist robe and holding a hand fan made of crane feathers.</p><p>Zhuge Liang was a Confucian-oriented ""Legalist"". He liked to compare himself to the sage minister Guan Zhong developing Shu's agriculture and industry to become a regional power. and attached great importance to the works of Shen Buhai and Han Fei refusing to indulge local elites and adopting strict but fair and clear laws. In remembrance of his governance local people maintained shrines to him for ages.</p><p>Zhuge is a two-character Chinese compound family name. His name – even his surname alone – has become synonymous with loyalty wisdom and strategy in Chinese culture.</p>


<h2><span id=""Early_life"">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Zhuge Liang was born in 181 in Yangdu County Langya Commandery (present-day Yishui Shandong Province). As his father Zhuge Gui died when he was still young he was raised by Zhuge Xuan (a cousin of Zhuge Gui) in Yuzhang Commandery. When Zhuge Xuan was driven out of Yuzhang Commandery in 195 Zhuge Liang followed Zhuge Xuan to live with his friend Liu Biao the governor of Jing Province.</p><p>Zhuge Liang grew to be a tall man (≈189 cm). He enjoyed reciting <i>Liangfu Yin</i> (<span lang=""zh"" title=""Chinese language text"">梁父吟</span>) a folk song popular in Shandong his birthplace. He had a habit of comparing himself to the sage minister Guan Zhong and military leader Yue Yi. Although few people took him seriously Zhuge Liang developed close friendships with influential members of the local literati such as Xu Shu Cui Zhouping Meng Jian and Shi Tao. Zhuge Liang also maintained close relations with other well-known intellectuals such as Sima Hui Pang Degong and Huang Chengyan. Huang Chengyan once told Zhuge Liang ""I heard that you're seeking a spouse. I've an ugly daughter with yellow skin and dark complexion but her talent matches yours."" Zhuge Liang agreed and married Huang Chengyan's daughter. Sima Hui compared Zhuge Liang to a sleeping dragon.</p>
<h2><span id=""Service_under_Liu_Bei"">Service under Liu Bei</span></h2>


<p>When Liu Bei was residing at Xinye County and taking shelter under Jing Province's governor Liu Biao he visited Sima Hui who told him ""Confucian academics and common scholars how much do they know about current affairs? Those who analyse current affairs well are elites. Crouching Dragon and Young Phoenix are the only ones in this region."" Xu Shu later recommended Zhuge Liang to Liu Bei again and Liu wanted to ask Xu to invite Zhuge to meet him. However Xu Shu replied ""You must visit this man in person. He cannot be invited to meet you."" Liu Bei succeeded in recruiting Zhuge Liang in 207 after paying three personal visits. This is contradicted in the later <i>Annotations</i> by Pei Songzhi which claim Zhuge Liang visited him first. Zhuge Liang presented the Longzhong Plan to Liu Bei and left his residence to follow Liu. Afterwards Liu Bei became very close to Zhuge Liang and often had discussions with him. Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were displeased with their relationship and complained about it. Liu Bei explained ""Now that I have Kongming I am like a fish that has found water. I hope you'll stop making unpleasant remarks."" Guan Yu and Zhang Fei then stopped complaining.
</p>
<h3><span id=""As_a_diplomat"">As a diplomat</span></h3>

<p>In 208 Liu Biao died and was succeeded by his younger son Liu Cong who surrendered Jing Province to Cao Cao. When Liu Bei heard of Liu Cong's surrender he led his followers (both troops and civilians) on an exodus southward to Xiakou engaging Cao Cao's forces in a brief skirmish at the Battle of Changban along the way. While in Xiakou Liu Bei sent Zhuge Liang to follow Lu Su to Jiangdong to discuss the formation of an alliance between him and Sun Quan.
</p><p>Zhuge Liang met Sun Quan in Chaisang and proposed two solutions to him ""If you can use the forces of Wuyue to resist the central government why not break ties (with Cao Cao) in advance? If you cannot oppose why not demobilise the troops discard your armour and surrender to the north?"" After Sun Quan's viceroy Zhou Yu analysed the situation and pointed out weaknesses in Cao Cao's army Sun finally agreed to ally with Liu Bei in resisting Cao Cao. Zhuge Liang returned to Liu Bei's camp with Sun Quan's envoy Lu Su to make preparation for the upcoming war.

<h3><span id=""As_a_logistics_officer"">As a logistics officer</span></h3>

<p>In late 208 the allied armies of Liu Bei and Sun Quan scored a decisive victory over Cao Cao's forces at the Battle of Red Cliffs. Cao Cao retreated to Ye city while Liu Bei proceeded to conquer territories in Jiangnan covering most of southern Jing Province. Zhuge Liang was appointed Military Advisor General of the Household (<span lang=""zh-Hant"" title=""Chinese language text"">軍師中郎將</span>). He was put in charge of governing Lingling (present day Yongzhou Hunan) Guiyang and Changsha commanderies and collecting taxes to fund the military.
</p><p>In 211 Liu Zhang governor of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) requested aid from Liu Bei in attacking Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. Liu Bei left Zhuge Liang Guan Yu Zhang Fei and others in charge of Jing Province while he led an army into Yi Province. Liu Bei promptly agreed to Liu Zhang's proposal but secretly planned to take over Liu Zhang's land. The following year Liu Zhang discovered Liu Bei's intention and the two turned hostile and waged war on each other. Zhuge Liang Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun led separate forces to reinforce Liu Bei in the attack on Yi Province's capital Chengdu while Guan Yu stayed behind to guard Jing Province. In 214 Liu Zhang surrendered and Liu Bei took control of Yi Province.
</p><p>Liu Bei appointed Zhuge Liang as Military Advisor General (<span lang=""zh-Hant"" title=""Chinese language text"">軍師將軍</span>) and let him administer affairs of his personal office (office of the General of the Left (<span lang=""zh-Hant"" title=""Chinese language text"">左將軍</span>)). Whenever Liu Bei embarked on military campaigns Zhuge Liang remained to defend Chengdu and ensured a steady flow of supply of troops and provisions. In 221 in response to Cao Pi's usurping of Emperor Xian's throne Liu Bei's subordinates advised him to declare himself emperor. After initially refusing Liu Bei was eventually persuaded by Zhuge Liang to do so and became ruler of Shu Han. Liu Bei named Zhuge Liang his chancellor and put him in charge of the imperial agency where Zhuge assumed the functions of the head of the imperial secretariat. Zhuge Liang was appointed Colonel-Director of Retainers (<span lang=""zh"" title=""Chinese language text"">司隸校尉</span>) after Zhang Fei's death.

<p>In the spring of 223 Liu Bei retreated to Yong'an (present-day Fengjie County Chongqing) after his defeat at the Battle of Xiaoting and became seriously ill. He summoned Zhuge Liang from Chengdu and said to him ""You're ten times more talented than Cao Pi and capable of both securing the country and accomplishing our great mission. If my son can be assisted then assist him. If he proves incompetent then you may take over the throne."" Zhuge Liang replied tearfully ""I'll do my utmost and serve with unwavering loyalty until death."" Liu Bei then ordered his son Liu Shan to administer state affairs together with Zhuge Liang and regard Zhuge as his father.
</p>
<h3><span id=""As_a_regent"">As a regent</span></h3>
<p>After Liu Bei's death Liu Shan ascended to the throne of Shu Han. He granted Zhuge Liang the title ""Marquis of Wu District"" (<span lang=""zh-Hant"" title=""Chinese language text"">武鄉侯</span>) and created an office for him. Not long later Zhuge Liang was appointed governor of Yi Province and put in charge of all state affairs. At the same time the commanderies in Nanzhong rebelled against Shu but Zhuge Liang did not send troops to suppress the revolt as Liu Bei's death was still recent. Liu Bei had been persuaded after his defeat by Lu Xun that an alliance with Wu was necessary. Zhuge sent Deng Zhi and Chen Zhen to make peace with Eastern Wu and reentered an alliance with Wu. Zhuge Liang would consistently send envoys to Wu to improve diplomatic relations between the two states.
</p>
<h4><span id=""Southern_Campaign"">Southern Campaign</span></h4>


<p>During his reign as regent Zhuge Liang set Shu's objective as the restoration of the Han dynasty which from Shu's point of view had been usurped by the state of Cao Wei. He felt that in order to attack Wei a complete unification of Shu was first needed. Zhuge Liang was worried that the local clans would work with the Nanman tribes in Nanzhong to stage a revolt. Fearing the possibility that the peasants might rebel and press into areas surrounding the capital Chengdu while he was attacking Wei in the north Zhuge Liang decided to pacify the southern tribes first.
</p><p>In the spring of 225 regional clans including Yong Gao Zhu and Meng had taken control of some cities in the south so Zhuge Liang led an expedition force to Nanzhong. Ma Su proposed that they should attempt to win the hearts of the Nanman and rally their support instead of using military force to subdue them. Zhuge Liang heeded Ma Su's advice and defeated the rebel leader Meng Huo on seven occasions as it was claimed in later histories such as the <i>Chronicles of Huayang</i>. He released Meng Huo each time in order to achieve Meng's genuine surrender. The story about Meng Huo's seven captures is recently questioned by many modern academics including historians such as Miao Yue Tan Liangxiao and Zhang Hualan.
</p><p>Realising he had no chance to win Meng Huo pledged allegiance to Shu and was appointed by Zhuge Liang as governor of the region to keep the populace content and secure the southern Shu border. This would ensure that the future Northern Expeditions would proceed without internal disruptions. Rich and abundant resources acquired from Nanzhong were used to fund Shu's military and the state became more prosperous.
</p>
<h4><span id=""Northern_Expeditions_and_death"">Northern Expeditions and death</span></h4>


<p>After pacifying the Nanman Zhuge Liang ordered the Shu military to make preparations for a large scale offensive on Wei. In 227 while in Hanzhong he wrote a memorial titled <i>Chu Shi Biao</i> to Liu Shan stating his rationale for the campaign and giving advice to the emperor on good governance. From 228 until his death in 234 Zhuge Liang launched a total of five Northern Expeditions against Wei all except one of which failed. During the first Northern Expedition Zhuge Liang persuaded Jiang Wei a young Wei military officer to surrender and defect to his side. Jiang Wei became a prominent general of Shu later and continued Zhuge Liang's legacy of an aggressive foreign policy against Wei. The other permanent gains by Shu were the conquests of the impoverished Wudu and Yinping commanderies as well as the relocation of Wei citizens to Shu territories on occasion.</p><p>In the spring of 231 Zhuge Liang finally met his nemesis Sima Yi (the newly appointed Wei commander) at the Battle of Mount Qi the deadliest campaign of the five expeditions in terms of death toll. In late 234 Zhuge Liang and Sima Yi reached a stalemate at the Battle of Wuzhang Plains. Straining his energy on military matters big and small Zhuge Liang fell seriously ill and eventually died in camp at the age of 53. Before his death Zhuge Liang recommended Jiang Wan and Fei Yi to succeed him as regent of Shu. He was buried on Mount Dingjun according to his dying wish and posthumously granted the title ""Marquis Zhongwu"" (忠武侯; literally ""loyal and martial marquis"") by Liu Shan.

One of Zhuge Liang's sisters married Pang Shanmin a cousin of Pang Tong while the other sister married a member of the prominent Kuai family headed by Kuai Liang and Kuai Yue in Xiangyang Commandery.
</p><p>Zhuge Liang married the daughter of Huang Chengyan. She was a maternal niece of Liu Biao and Lady Cai because her mother (Huang Chengyan's wife) was Lady Cai's younger sister. Although her name was not recorded in history she is commonly referred to by the name ""Huang Yueying"" in popular culture.
</p><p>Zhuge Liang had at least two sons. His elder son Zhuge Zhan served as a general in Shu and was killed in action during the Conquest of Shu by Wei. His younger son Zhuge Huai (<span lang=""zh"" title=""Chinese language text"">諸葛懷</span>) lived as a commoner during the Jin dynasty. Zhuge Liang initially had no sons so he adopted his nephew Zhuge Qiao (Zhuge Jin's son). Zhuge Qiao served in Shu and died at a relatively young age. According to legend Zhuge Liang had a daughter Zhuge Guo (<span lang=""zh"" title=""Chinese language text"">諸葛果</span>) but her existence is disputed by historians.
</p><p>Zhuge Qiao's son Zhuge Pan (<span lang=""zh"" title=""Chinese language text"">諸葛攀</span>) returned to Eastern Wu after Zhuge Ke's death to continue Zhuge Jin's family line there. Zhuge Zhan had three sons. The eldest Zhuge Shang served Shu and was killed in action together with his father.

It was said to be invented by Zhuge Liang when he was trapped by Sima Yi in Pingyang. Friendly forces nearby saw the message on the lantern paper covering and came to Zhuge Liang's aid. Another belief is that the lantern resembled Zhuge Liang's headdress so it was named after him.

For example the <i>Thirty-Six Stratagems</i> and <i>Mastering the Art of War</i> (not to be confused with Sun Tzu's <i>The Art of War</i>) are two commonly available works attributed to Zhuge Liang. Supposedly his mastery of infantry and cavalry formation tactics based on the Taoist classic <i>I Ching</i> were unrivalled. His memorial the <i>Chu Shi Biao</i> written prior to the Northern Expeditions provided a salutary reflection of his unwavering loyalty to the state of Shu. The memorial moved some readers to tears. In addition he wrote <i>Admonition to His Son</i> (<span lang=""zh-Hant"" title=""Chinese language text"">諸葛亮誡子書</span>) in which he reflected on his humbleness and frugality in pursuit of a meaningful life.</p><p>Zhuge Liang is also the subject of many Chinese literary works. A poem by Du Fu a prolific Tang dynasty poet was written in memory of Zhuge Liang whose legacy of unwavering dedication seems to have been forgotten in Du Fu's generation (judging by the description of Zhuge Liang' unkept temple). Some historians believe that Du Fu had compared himself with Zhuge Liang in the poem. The full text is:

Perch|"Perch is a common name for fish of the genus Perca freshwater gamefish belonging to the family Percidae.  The perch of which  three species occur in different geographical areas lend their name to a large order of vertebrates: the Perciformes from the Greek: πέρκη (perke) simply meaning perch and the Latin forma meaning shape.  Many species of freshwater gamefish more or less resemble perch but belong to different genera. In fact the exclusively saltwater-dwelling red drum is often referred to as a red perch though by definition perch are freshwater fish. Though many fish are referred to as perch as a common name to be considered a true perch the fish must be of the family Percidae.
The type species for this genus is the European perch P. fluviatilis.

Battle_of_Al_Wajbah|The Battle of Al Wajbah was an armed conflict that took place in March 1893 in Qatar a province of the Ottoman Empire's Najd sanjak at that time. The conflict was initiated after Ottoman officials imprisoned 16 Qatari tribal leaders and ordered a column of troops to march toward the Al Thani stronghold in the village of Al Wajbah in response to kaymakam Jassim Al Thani's refusal to come to Ottoman authority.The main battle took place in Al Wajbah Fort. After the Ottomans' unsuccessful attempt at seizing the fort they retreated first to Shebaka Fort and then to their fort in Al Bidda. Shortly after Al Thani's troop besieged the fortress and cut off the water supply of the neighborhood resulting in the concession of defeat by the Ottomans. Following this was an agreement to relinquish the Qatari captives in return for the safe passage of Mehmed Pasha's cavalry to Hofuf by land.Although Qatar did not gain full independence from the Ottoman Empire the result of the battle is seen by Qatar...|1

Mesozoa|"The Mesozoa (singular: mesozoan) are minuscule worm-like parasites of marine invertebrates. Generally these tiny elusive creatures consist of a somatoderm (outer layer) of ciliated cells surrounding one or more reproductive cells. Decades ago Mesozoa were classified as a phylum. Molecular phylogeny studies however have shown that the mysterious mesozoans are monophyletic and emerged in the Lophotrochozoa as sister of the Rouphozoa.As a result of these recent findings in molecular biology the label mesozoan is now often applied informally rather than as a formal taxon. Some workers previously classified Mesozoa as the sole phylum of the lonely subkingdom Agnotozoa. Cavalier-Smith argued that at least some of the mesozoans are in fact protistans not animals.In the 19th century the Mesozoa were a wastebasket taxon for multicellular organisms which lacked the invaginating gastrula which was thought to define the Metazoa.

Clupeiformes|"Clupeiformes is the order of ray-finned fish that includes the herring family Clupeidae and the anchovy family Engraulidae. The group includes many of the most important forage and food fish.
Clupeiformes are physostomes which means that the gas bladder has a pneumatic duct connecting it to the gut. They typically lack a lateral line but still have the eyes fins and scales that are common to most fish though not all fish have these attributes. They are generally silvery fish with streamlined spindle-shaped bodies and they often school. Most species eat plankton which they filter from the water with their gill rakers.

Mabitac was linked to the garrison town of Siniloan by a causeway which on the day of the battle was flooded with water (in many parts waist-deep). The water in the flanking rice fields was even deeper making it impossible to properly deploy off the narrow road. Trenches occupied by Filipinos under Cailles cut across this causeway blocking the path into Mabitac.

Belgica_antarctica|"Belgica antarctica the Antarctic midge is a species of flightless midge endemic to the continent of Antarctica. At 2–6 mm (0.079–0.24 in) long it is the largest purely terrestrial animal native to the continent as well as its only insect.
It also has the smallest known insect genome as of 2014 with only 99 million base pairs of nucleotides (and about 13500 genes). It is the only insect that can survive year-round in Antarctica.


== Tolerance to extreme conditions ==
The flightlessness of B. antarctica may be an adaptation to prevent wind from blowing it into inhospitable areas. It can survive freezing but though local air temperatures may reach as low as −40 °C this insect cannot survive temperatures below −15 °C. This is comparatively milder than other cold-adapted insects. The reason for this relatively low freezing tolerance is due to thermal buffering: just burrowing at a depth of 1 cm temperature is stable between 0 and −2 °C for 10 months out of 12 and it seldom goes lower..."|0

Obligate_aerobe|"An obligate aerobe is an organism that requires oxygen to grow.  Through cellular respiration these organisms use oxygen to metabolise substances like sugars or fats to obtain energy. In this type of respiration oxygen serves as the terminal electron acceptor for the electron transport chain.  Aerobic respiration has the advantage of yielding more energy (adenosine triphosphate or ATP) than fermentation or anaerobic respiration but obligate aerobes are subject to high levels of oxidative stress.Examples of obligately aerobic bacteria include Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Nocardia asteroides.  With the exception of the yeasts most fungi are obligate aerobes.  Also almost all algae are obligate aerobes.

Zebra|"Zebras (subgenus Hippotigris) are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. There are three extant species: the Grévy's zebra (Equus grevyi) plains zebra (E. quagga) and the mountain zebra (E. zebra). Zebras share the genus Equus with horses and asses the three groups being the only living members of the family Equidae. Zebra stripes come in different patterns unique to each individual. Several theories have been proposed for the function of these stripes with most evidence supporting them as a form of protection from biting flies. Zebras inhabit eastern and southern Africa and can be found in a variety of habitats such as savannahs grasslands woodlands shrublands and mountainous areas.

Tetraodontiformes|"The Tetraodontiformes are an order of highly derived ray-finned fish also called the Plectognathi. Sometimes these are classified as a suborder of the order Perciformes. The Tetraodontiformes are represented by 10 extant families and at least 349 species overall; most are marine and dwell in and around tropical coral reefs but a few species are found in freshwater streams and estuaries. They have no close relatives and descend from a line of coral-dwelling species that emerged around 80 million years ago.

Zosterops|"Zosterops (meaning ""eye-girdle"") is a genus of passerine birds containing the typical white-eyes in the white-eye family Zosteropidae. The genus has the largest number of species in the white-eye family. They occur in the Afrotropical Indomalayan and Australasian realms. Typical white-eyes have a length of between 8 and 15 cm (3 and 6 in). Their most characteristic feature is a conspicuous white feather ring around the eye though some species lack it. The species in this group vary in the structural adaptations of the tongue. The Zosterops [griseotinctus] group is an example of a ""great speciator"" inhabiting a vast area and showing a remarkable morphological differentiation on islands some of which maybe as close as 2 km (1.2 mi) apart.

The genus Zosterops was introduced by the naturalists Nicholas Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827. The type species was subsequently designated as the Malagasy white-eye. The name Zosterops combines the Ancient Greek words zōstēros..."|0
Hexactinellid|"Hexactinellid sponges are sponges with a skeleton made of four- and/or six-pointed siliceous spicules often referred to as glass sponges.

Battle_of_the_Great_Redan|"The Battle of the Great Redan  was a major battle during the Crimean War fought between British forces against Russia on 18 June and 8 September 1855 as a part of the Siege of Sevastopol. The French army successfully stormed the Malakoff redoubt whereas a simultaneous British attack on the Great Redan to the south of the Malakoff was repulsed. Contemporary commentators have suggested that although the Redan became so important to the Victorians it was probably not vital to the taking of Sevastopol. The fort at Malakhov was much more important and it was in the French sphere of influence. It was when the French stormed it after an eleven-month siege that the final somewhat unnecessary attack on the Redan was made.

Creating an airlift presented the AAF a considerable challenge in 1942: it had no units trained or equipped for moving cargo and no airfields existed in the China Burma India Theater (CBI) for basing the large number of transports that would be needed. Flying over the Himalayas was extremely dangerous and made more difficult by a lack of reliable charts an absence of radio navigation aids and a dearth of information about the weather.The task was initially given to the AAF's Tenth Air Force and then to its Air Transport Command (ATC).

Zawiya rose against Gaddafi on 24 February and formed an important strategic obstacle to loyalists. Strong loyalist efforts were made to recover the city and after withstanding two to three weeks of assault by two mechanized brigades (the Khamis and Hosban) the city fell on 10 March.

Battle_of_Saint-Denis_(1837)|"The Battle of Saint-Denis was fought on November 23 1837 between British colonial authorities under Lieutenant-Colonel Gore and Patriote rebels in Lower Canada as part of the Lower Canada Rebellion. The Patriotes were led by Wolfred Nelson. Gore was sent to quell the uprising in the Richelieu River valley in conjunction with a force led by Lieutenant-Colonel George Wetherall. Gore was the first to arrive at a Patriote-held site. Nelson had organized the defence with most of the well-armed rebels within a stone house that overlooked the road. Gore accompanied by only one cannon attempted to take the stone house three times with the cannon providing ineffective fire. Another attempt to flank the house to the left failed when Gore's soldiers encountered the less well-armed militia. Running out of ammunition the British retreated. This marked the only Patriote victory in 1837 as this battle was followed by two defeats at Saint-Charles and Saint-Eustache.

Buddy_Bolden|"Charles Joseph ""Buddy"" Bolden (September 6 1877 – November 4 1931) was an American cornetist who was regarded by contemporaries as a key figure in the development of a New Orleans style of ragtime music or ""jass"" which later came to be known as jazz.


== Childhood ==
Bolden's father Westmore Bolden worked as a ""driver"" for William Walker the former master of Buddy's grandfather Gustavus Bolden (who died in 1866) at the time of Buddy's birth; his mother Alice (née Harris) was 18 on August 14 1873 when she married Westmore (who was around 25 at the time as records indicate he was 19 in August 1866). His father died when Buddy was six after which the boy lived with his mother and family members. In records of the period the family name is variously spelled Bolen Bolding Boldan and Bolden thus complicating research. Buddy likely attended Fisk School in New Orleans though evidence is circumstantial as early records of this and other local schools are missing.

Its taxonomic history is potentially confusing. It was formerly known as Pyrrhura perlata but following a review it was discovered that the type specimen long believed to belong to this species actually was a juvenile of the closely related crimson-bellied parakeet. Consequently P. perlata was transferred to that species while the next name in line for the pearly parakeet P. lepida became its valid scientific name.Traditionally three subspecies of the pearly parakeet have been recognized: Western anerythra eastern  nominate lepida and far eastern coerulescens. In 2011 a review found that lepida and coerulescens were inseparable (both have some red to the wings and virtually no red to the belly in adults).

False_potto|"The false potto (Pseudopotto martini) is a lorisoid primate of uncertain taxonomic status found in Africa. Anthropologist Jeffrey H. Schwartz named it in 1996 as the only species of the genus Pseudopotto on the basis of two specimens (consisting only of skeletal material) that had previously been identified as pottos (Perodicticus potto). The precise provenances of the two specimens are uncertain but at least one may have come from Cameroon. Schwartz thought the false potto could even represent a separate family but other researchers have argued that the supposed distinguishing features of the animal do not actually distinguish it from the potto; specifically the false potto shares several features with West African pottos.
The false potto generally resembles a small potto but according to Schwartz it differs in having a longer tail shorter spines on its neck and chest vertebrae a smaller less complex spine on the second neck vertebra an entepicondylar foramen (an opening in the..."|0

He was the lead singer and lyricist of the post-punk band Joy Division and recorded two albums with the group: Unknown Pleasures (1979) and Closer (1980). Curtis was known for his bass-baritone voice dance style and songwriting typically filled with imagery of desolation emptiness and alienation. 
Curtis suffered from epilepsy and depression and took his own life on the eve of Joy Division's first North American tour and shortly before the release of Closer. His death led to the band's dissolution and the subsequent formation of New Order.

Symbion|"Symbion is the name of a genus of commensal aquatic animals less than 0.5 mm wide found living attached to the mouthparts of cold-water lobsters. They have sac-like bodies and three distinctly different forms in different parts of their two-stage life-cycle. They appear so different from other animals that they were assigned their own new phylum Cycliophora shortly after they were discovered in 1995. This was the first new phylum of multicelled organism to be discovered since the Loricifera in 1983.

Battle_of_the_Margus|"The Battle of the Margus was fought in July 285 between the armies of Roman Emperors Diocletian and Carinus in the valley of the Margus River (today Great Morava) in Moesia (present day Serbia). The battle proved to be the tipping-point that led to the eventual resolution of the Crisis of the Third Century and the return of stability to the Empire.
Carinus led the larger force but the loyalty of his army was definitely questionable. Carinus had allegedly alienated men whose support his success depended upon including mistreating the Senate and its womenfolk and seducing the wives of his officers. The exact circumstances of the battle are in doubt but it is known for certain that Carinus was killed in the course of the battle most probably by one of his own officers.Diocletian was then left in sole control of the Roman Empire.

Gadidae|"The Gadidae are a family of marine fish included in the order Gadiformes known as the cods codfishes or true cods.  It contains several commercially important fishes including the cod haddock whiting and pollock.
Most gadid species are found in temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere but several range into subtropical subarctic and Arctic oceans and a single (southern blue whiting) is found in the Southern Hemisphere. They are generally medium-sized fish and are distinguished by the presence of three dorsal fins on the back and two anal fins on the underside. Most species have barbels on their chins which they use while browsing on the sea floor. Gadids are carnivorous feeding on smaller fish and crustaceans.Gadids are highly prolific producing several million eggs at each spawning. This contributes to their high population numbers which in turn makes commercial fishing relatively easy.Concepts differ about the contents of the family Gadidae. The system followed by..."|0

Wild_horse|The wild horse (Equus ferus) is a species of the genus Equus which includes as subspecies the modern domesticated horse (Equus ferus caballus) as well as the undomesticated tarpan (Equus ferus ferus now extinct) and the endangered Przewalski's horse (Equus ferus przewalskii).Przewalski's horse had reached the brink of extinction but was reintroduced successfully into the wild. The tarpan became extinct in the 19th century though it is a possible ancestor of the domestic horse; it roamed the steppes of Eurasia at the time of domestication. However other subspecies of Equus ferus may have existed and could have been the stock from which domesticated horses are descended.  Since the extinction of the tarpan attempts have been made to reconstruct its phenotype resulting in horse breeds such as the Konik and Heck horse.  However the genetic makeup and foundation bloodstock of those breeds is substantially derived from domesticated horses so these breeds possess domesticated traits....|0
