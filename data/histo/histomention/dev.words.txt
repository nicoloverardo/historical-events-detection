CAVA DEI TIRRENI , March 8th . 
We have spent the day in the streets and houses of Pompeii , living over again in the buried city the thrilling scenes of Lord Lytton 's novel . 
His descriptions are still marvellously accurate , although so much has been unearthed since he wrote " The Last Days of Pompeii " that the ruins as they stand to-day are much more extensive than those pictured by the novelist . 
The house of Glaucus is called by the guides the House of the Tragic Poet , but the mosaic of the dog , with its inscription , " Cave canem , " apparently as perfect as in the days when Glaucus thus whimsically greeted his friends and enemies , serves to identify it . 
Lord Lytton was in Naples during the winter of the most important excavations at Pompeii , and his romance doubtless took form and shape as he walked through these deserted streets , where the ruts made by the chariot-wheels of the two rivals , Glaucus and Arbaces , are still to be seen . 
The houses , as he tells us , still undespoiled of their exquisite decorations and rich furniture , were much as their unfortunate owners left them . 
Even now , despite the fact that many of the beautiful frescoes , statues , busts , and other ornaments have been taken to the Naples Museum , much is still left of the interior of the houses , enough to give one a very good idea of how these luxurious Pompeians lived . 
The lower floors of some of these houses , as that of the Vettii and the Faun , are complete , with their vestibule , dining-room , parlor , bedrooms , and kitchen . 
These rooms are all rather small , according to our ideas , as the wise Pompeians lived out of doors , spending their days in the large central court of their houses or in the gardens . 
Of the gardens we saw the most perfect examples in the house of the Vettii . 
The restoration seems to have been made most carefully here as elsewhere ; even the graceful bronze statuettes are not wanting , as excellent replicas have been put in the places of the originals , which are in the Naples Museum . 
Nothing brings the reality of that old life before us more forcibly than to walk along the streets , where the bakeries and the wine and oil shops are still to be found . 
In the latter are many great jars , which are , as Zelphine says , not unlike those in which Morgiana entrapped her Forty Thieves . 
Turning a corner , we were startled by seeing a roughly drawn sketch upon a wall , such as any street gamin of to-day might draw upon a tempting blank surface . 
Further along the same street we beheld a still stronger evidence that the life of Pompeii was not altogether different from that of our own time . 
Something corresponding to a modern poster announced in red letters the name of a favorite candidate for the next municipal election . 
We lingered long in the vast amphitheatre , in which the Pompeians were wont to take their pleasure , protected in sunny weather by an awning , whose usefulness we could appreciate to-day , as the sun of March is intensely hot in this region . 
The barracks for the gladiators , near the theatre , are not unlike the casemates for soldiers in a fort , and are quite complete . 
Zelphine , who is sitting near me , poring over Bulwer 's novel , has just read me Pansa 's lament over what he considered an infamous law , that forbade a man to send his own slaves to the wild beasts in the arena . 
Having seen the houses of Glaucus and Pansa , one can more readily understand the point of view of these luxurious , pleasure-loving ancients , who were probably not more cruel than many of their contemporaries . 
We left Pompeii late this afternoon and came to La Cava , a pretty town in the mountains , where we are stopping on our way to Pæstum . 
Zelphine has just been talking to the padrone , who speaks excellent English , about the excursion to-morrow . 
Our tickets , which we bought of the concierge at the Hotel B. , entitle us to a drive or a railway journey . 
The padrone strongly advises the former . 
He says the trains are so slow and the waits so long that we make almost as good time by driving , and then it is much more interesting . 
The drive is between forty and fifty miles , but by starting at eight o'clock in the morning , and changing horses at Battipaglia , we shall have two hours at Pæstum and get back to this hotel in time for dinner . 
Another party of American travellers , of the inconvenient number of five , go by coach to-morrow . 
The padrone asks us , in case we decide to drive , whether we will give a seat in our carriage to the odd number . 
Having concluded to drive , we are hoping that the fifth wheel of the other coaching-party may prove to be Mrs. Coxe , a charming old lady who talks most picturesquely of a drive to Pæstum forty years ago , when the roads were so infested by brigands that it was necessary to travel with a mounted escort . " 
Could anything be more delightfully romantic ? " 
exclaims Zelphine , on hearing this . " 
Or more horridly uncomfortable ? " 
adds Angela . 
These exclamations drew from Mrs. Coxe a detailed and spirited recital of her adventures , which Zelphine heard with the great wide-open eyes of a child listening to a fairy-tale . 
Women of Mrs. Coxe 's age delight in a sympathetic listener . 
The members of her own party have doubtless heard all of her contes de voyage . 
She will certainly elect to go with us , and have the advantage of a new and appreciative audience . 
VESUVIUS 
CLIMBING A VOLCANO 
Everybody who comes to Naples , - that is , everybody except the lady who fell from her horse the other day at Resina and injured her shoulder , as she was mounting for the ascent , - everybody , I say , goes up Vesuvius , and nearly every one writes impressions and descriptions of the performance . 
If you believe the tales of travelers , it is an undertaking of great hazard , an experience of frightful emotions . 
How unsafe it is , especially for ladies , I heard twenty times in Naples before I had been there a day . 
Why , there was a lady thrown from her horse and nearly killed , only a week ago ; and she still lay ill at the next hotel , a witness of the truth of the story . 
I imagined her plunged down a precipice of lava , or pitched over the lip of the crater , and only rescued by the devotion of a gallant guide , who threatened to let go of her if she did n't pay him twenty francs instantly . 
This story , which will live and grow for years in this region , a waxing and never-waning peril of the volcano , I found , subsequently , had the foundation I have mentioned above . 
The lady did go to Resina in order to make the ascent of Vesuvius , mounted a horse there , fell off , being utterly unhorsewomanly , and hurt herself ; but her injury had no more to do with Vesuvius than it had with the entrance of Victor Emanuel into Naples , which took place a couple of weeks after . 
Well , as I was saying , it is the fashion to write descriptions of Vesuvius ; and you might as well have mine , which I shall give to you in rough outline . 
There came a day when the Tramontane ceased to blow down on us the cold air of the snowy Apennines , and the white cap of Vesuvius , which is , by the way , worn generally like the caps of the Neapolitans , drifted inland instead of toward the sea . 
Warmer weather had come to make the bright sunshine no longer a mockery . 
For some days I had been getting the gauge of the mountain . 
With its white plume it is a constant quantity in the landscape : one sees it from every point of view ; and we had been scarcely anywhere that volcanic remains , or signs of such action , - a thin crust shaking under our feet , as at Solfatara , where blasts of sulphurous steam drove in our faces , - did not remind us that the whole ground is uncertain , and undermined by the subterranean fires that have Vesuvius for a chimney . 
All the coast of the bay , within recent historic periods , in different spots at different times , has risen and sunk and risen again , in simple obedience to the pulsations of the great fiery monster below . 
It puffs up or sinks , like the crust of a baking apple-pie . 
This region is evidently not done ; and I think it not unlikely it may have to be turned over again before it is . 
We had seen where Herculaneum lies under the lava and under the town of Resina ; we had walked those clean and narrow streets of Pompeii , and seen the workmen picking away at the imbedded gravel , sand , and ashes which still cover nearly two thirds of the nice little , tight little Roman city ; we had looked at the black gashes on the mountain-sides , where the lava streams had gushed and rolled and twisted over vineyards and villas and villages ; and we decided to take a nearer look at the immediate cause of all this abnormal state of things . 
GENOA , February 21st . 
A note has just come from your cousin , Genevra Fuller , urging us to make her a visit at her home in San Remo . 
This invitation , which is most cordial , is a temptation to us all , but Zelphine and Angela have promised to spend their time with friends in Nice , stopping for a day at Monte Carlo , if their sporting tastes lead them so far afield , while I yield to Genevra 's blandishments . 
You know of old that she is not a person to be lightly refused when she has set her heart upon any given thing - a family trait , I believe . 
RIVIERA , February 22d . 
Of course the sun was shining when we left Genoa . 
We were glad to see how fair La Superba could be , with her terraced gardens , many villas , and noble background of blue mountains . 
Indeed , I confess to some qualms of conscience , feeling that I may have given you a too gloomy picture of the fine old city ; but how can one give a cheerful view of the attractions of a place where one 's gayest hours were spent in a cemetery ? 
Our way lay along the sea by the Western Riviera , one of the garden spots of the world . 
The railroad winds in and out among the rocks , or into tunnels pierced through them , often running parallel with the famous Cornice Drive , which was for many years the only road from Genoa to Nice . 
The beauty of this drive , which lies sometimes between the railroad and the sea and again ascends the rocky heights beyond , made us wish that railroads had never been invented . 
A coach and four , a Cinderella coach , would be the only suitable equipage in which to make this journey into fairyland . " 
Why did we not drive ? " 
I hear you ask , and you may well ask . 
Because the railroad , dashing in and out of tunnels , often crosses the drive most unexpectedly and on the grade . 
Even Zelphine , much as she wished to drive over the self-same road taken by her dear Lucy in " Doctor Antonio , " hesitated about imperilling her neck , and I was quite resolute upon this point . 
And if Zelphine and I were so reckless as to be willing to risk our own lives , have we not under our care the only and well-beloved daughter of the ancient and honorable house of Haldane ? 
Did I say that the train dashed ? 
Really , that was a slip of the pen - nothing dashes in Italy except a mountain torrent ; but where there are so many grade crossings , even a slow train may be dangerous . 
We proceeded moderately and sedately upon our shining way , skirting the sapphire sea , dotted here and there with green islands . 
Reaching far out into the blue , one may see small towns which seem bent upon washing their white houses to a more dazzling whiteness in the clear water , painted towns against a painted sea and sky . 
Other hamlets and villas , with their green jalousies and their luxuriant gardens full of flowers and orange-trees , are on the heights above , and not seldom a solitary sanctuary is seen , perched upon some sea-washed cliff , the cherished guardian of the shore . 
Now indeed , looking up at the terraced olive-groves , we feel that we are in Italy . 
For many miles the road lies beside these gardens , which are monuments to Italian thrift and industry , as every square inch of the scanty earth on the hillsides is held in place by stone walls , one above another , until some are almost mountain high , olive-trees growing to the very top . 
On the sunny plains between the hills are acres of carnations , violets , stock-gillies , and mignonette , which fill the air with their delicious fragrance . 
From these immense gardens the large cities are supplied with flowers , and also the manufactories of perfumes . 
Hundreds of the beautiful blossoms , they tell us , are sacrificed to make a single drop of essence . 
We passed by Albenga and Alassio , over the suspension bridge at Porto Maurizio , and so on to Taggia , which is near San Remo , where we three were to part company for a few days . 
Off to the right we could see the picturesque ruins of Bussana Vecchia , destroyed by an earthquake as late as 1887 , never rebuilt , and now standing silent and desolate on the hill-top above its namesake , the little modern town of Bussana Nuova . 
Our view of Poggio and Bussana Vecchia was suddenly cut off by an inopportune tunnel , from which we emerged into the brilliant sunshine , to see before us the pretty villas , the waving palms , and the general air of cultivation and bien-être that belong to this favorite and highly favored town . 
When Zelphine and Angela caught this glimpse of San Remo from the train , and saw Genevra 's children waiting for me at the station , I am quite sure they repented them of their decision . 
I had not seen Roger and Phœbe since they were babies , but I knew them at once , and we are already fast friends . 
Genevra 's welcome , as you may believe , was of the warmest . 
It is delightful to be in a home again , after tossing about in a state-room and knocking around in strange hotels , and in a home as charming as this ! 
Night at Pompeii 
On to Pompeii in the clear sunset , falling very lightly upon mountains , islands , little ports , and indentations of the bay . 
From the railway station we walked above half a mile to the Albergo del Sole under a lucid heaven of aqua-marine colour , with Venus large in it upon the border line between the tints of green and blue . 
The Albergo del Sole is worth commemorating . 
We stepped , without the intervention of courtyard or entrance hall , straight from the little inn garden into an open , vaulted room . 
This was divided into two compartments by a stout column supporting round arches . 
Wooden gates furnished a kind of fence between the atrium and what an old Pompeian would have styled the triclinium . 
For in the further part a table was laid for supper and lighted with suspended lamps . 
And here a party of artists and students drank and talked and smoked . 
A great live peacock , half asleep and winking his eyes , sat perched upon a heavy wardrobe watching them . 
The outer chamber , where we waited in armchairs of ample girth , had its loggia windows and doors open to the air . 
There were singing-birds in cages ; and plants of rosemary , iris , and arundo sprang carelessly from holes in the floor . 
A huge vase filled to overflowing with oranges and lemons , the very symbol of generous prodigality , stood in the midst , and several dogs were lounging round . 
The outer twilight , blending with the dim sheen of the lamps , softened this pretty scene to picturesqueness . 
Altogether it was a strange and unexpected place . 
Much experienced as the nineteenth-century nomad may be in inns , he will rarely receive a more powerful and refreshing impression , entering one at evenfall , than here . 
There was no room for us in the inn . 
We were sent , attended by a boy with a lantern , through fields of dew-drenched barley and folded poppies , to a farmhouse overshadowed by four spreading pines . 
Exceedingly soft and grey , with rose-tinted weft of steam upon its summit , stood Vesuvius above us in the twilight . 
Something in the recent impression of the dimly lighted supper-room , and in the idyllic simplicity of this lantern-litten journey through the barley , suggested , by one of those inexplicable stirrings of association which affect tired senses , a dim , dreamy thought of Palestine and Bible stories . 
The feeling of the cenacolo blent here with feelings of Ruth 's cornfields , and the white square houses with their flat roofs enforced the illusion . 
Here we slept in the middle of a contadino colony . 
Some of the folk had made way for us ; and by the wheezing , coughing , and snoring of several sorts and ages in the chamber next me , I imagine they must have endured considerable crowding . 
My bed was large enough to have contained a family . 
Over its bead there was a little shrine , hollowed in the thickness of the wall , with several sacred emblems and a shallow vase of holy water . 
On dressers at each end of the room stood glass shrines , occupied by finely dressed Madonna dolls and pots of artificial flowers . 
Above the doors S. Michael and S. Francis , roughly embossed in low relief and boldly painted , gave dignity and grandeur to the walls . 
These showed some sense for art in the first builders of the house . 
But the taste of the inhabitants could not be praised . 
There were countless gaudy prints of saints , and exactly five pictures of the Bambino , very big , and sprawling in a field alone . 
A crucifix , some old bottles , a gun , old clothes suspended from pegs , pieces of peasant pottery and china , completed the furniture of the apartment . 
But what a view it showed when Christian next morning opened the door ! 
From my bed I looked across the red-tiled terrace to the stone-pines with their velvet roofage and the blue-peaked hills of Stabiae .

ARMENIA PREPARED FOR A HARD FIGHT 
TIFLIS , Transcaucasia , July 17 ( Associated Press ) . 
- Armenia temporarily is in no danger of going Bolshevist unless the Moscow Government sends a great Russian force against it , in the opinion of observers who have just returned from Shusha , Erivan and Nakhitchevan , after a careful study in the field of the military situation . 
Both the Georgians and Armenians , say these observers , had a terrible object lesson of what espousal of Bolshevism may mean in the frightful way the Tartars of Azerbaijan were slaughtered by the Russians when they resented Bolshevist domination . 
The observers point out that the Bolsheviki must actually fight their way into Armenia through the mountain forces of General Dro , an experienced Russian Armenian leader , who has barely 10,00 mountain tribesmen in Nakhitchevan , waging a ruthless war on Tartars who cross the Armenian boundaries . 
General Dro threw a bomb at the tyrannical Governor of Baku in 1904 . 
He fought with the Russians in the early part of the European war , and when he visited the hospital at Tiflis , where Dro was recovering from wounds . 
He is a magnetic , small man of about 40 , wears no uniform , and his soldiers call him merely Dro . 
The General does not disguise his hatred for the Bolsheviki . 
He operates independently of the main Armenian Army , and is generally respected and feared by the rough bands which blindly follow him . 
These bands wage guerrilla warfare mercilessly . 
They lack ammunitition , and consequently use the bayonet freely .

DANGEROUS OPERATION ON THOMAS A. EDISON 
Surgeons Remove Mastoid Abscess Near the Inventor 's Ear . 
Action Hurried to Prevent Blood Poisoning - Patient Has Long Suffered from Trouble . 
Special to The New York Times . 
ORANGE , Tuesday , Jan. 24 . 
- A serious operation was performed on Thomas A. Edison , the investor , at his home , Glenmont , in Llewellyn Park , a suburb of West Orange , last last night , and at 1:30 o'clock this morning he had not recovered from the effects of the anaesthetic . 
The operation was for a mastoid abscess behind the left ear and very close to the brain . 
The doctors began work shortly before 11 o'clock and finished at midnight . 
The operating surgeon was Dr. Arthur B. Duel of 254 Madison Avenue , Manhattan , assisted by Dr. Edward B. Bench of 17 West Forty-fifth Street , an assistant , who administered the anaesthetic . 
Dr. John Hammond Bradshaw of Orange , the Edison family physician , was also present . 
Mr. Edison , as has been generally known , has been deaf for many years . 
He was taken ill about a year ago , suffering great pain , but was still able to be about . 
An operation was broached several days ago , but there was strong hope until yesterday that it might be avoided . 
It developed yesterday , however , that , while Mr. Edison was better in many particulars , the growth was not yielding to treatment , and the conclusion was reached that the operation would have to be performed at once . 
Mr. Edison was told , and immediately preparations were made . 
Dr. Duel arrived in Orange after dinner with his assistant . 
Mr. Edison seemed perfectly composed though fully realizing the seriousness of the matter . 
At 1:40 o'clock this morning it was said that Mr. Edison 's general condition was good and that there was no immediate danger . 
The operation was pronounced a success , and it was said that it had been performed just in time to save much more serious trouble . 
Dr. Bradshaw made the following statement : " It was decided this afternoon that it was best to operate before Mr. Edison 's life was placed in jeopardy and to prevent blood poisoning . 
The indications thus far are favorable . 
Mr. Edison has rallied well and there are no untoward symptoms at the present time . 
His life is not now considered in danger . " 
Dr. Duel , it was said , would remain at the patient 's bedside all night . 
The annual ball of the employes of the Edison works at West Orange , numbering about 2,000 , was held here to-night , under the auspices of the factory fire department . 
Many of the higher officials of the company attended , all being ignorant of the fact that their chief was under the surgeon 's knife . 
Mr. Edison is fifty-seven years old .

Dr. Garnett 's Library 
The sale of the late Dr. Richard Garnett 's library , which was announced in the The Times in July last , has been fixed for December 6 , and Messrs. Sotheby , Wilkinson , and Hodge 's catalogue of it enumerates 395 lots . 
It forms one of the most interesting libraries which have been put up for sale in recent years . 
Three lots consist of as many note-books of Percy B. Shelley , containing manuscript matter of the highest interest , of which a considerable portion is unpublished . 
Those note-books were given by Shelley 's widow to her son , Sir Percy Shelley , and he and Lady Shelley gave them to Dr. Garnett . 
All the other note-books of the poet are in the Bodleian Library , and it seems a pity that these three note-books are not in some public institution . 
The published and unpublished matter in each note-book is clearly set out by Mr. W. M. Rossetti ; the first book contains five pieces of unpublished matter , in the second there are ten , and in the third six . 
They appear to be ideas , passing thoughts , and lines noted down by the poet at odd times and in different places , and possibly if they were published would not add much to the poet 's reputation as a thinker and a poet ; but the mere fact that they are Shelley 's gives them a very great literary and commercial value . 
There are also nearly 100 volumes of editions and " Lives " of Shelley , some of which are presentation copies , while others are manuscript notes . 
The collection of modern poetry is an extensive one , and the library is also rich in books and pamphlets relating to the British Museum , in books on bibliography , astrology , and palmistry , biography and history , in the publications of the Appledore and other private presses , and in the Transactions and Proceedings of various societies , and an unusually large number of presentation copies with autograph inscriptions . 
Dr. Garnett 's own books also figure in the catalogue , there being , among others , a copy of his first work , " Primula : A Book of Lyrics , " 1858 , an exceedingly scarce book , with numerous manuscript notes and corrections by the author . 
Of the several books by Coventry Patmore , the most interesting is a presentation copy from the author to Dr. Garnett of " Odes , " privately printed in 1868 for distribution among a few friends ; nearly the whole of this edition was burnt by the author himself . 
One " lot " consists of 42 volumes of tracts and pamphlets on a great variety of topics , many being presentation copies .

Englishman 's Motor Race 
PARIS . 
June 28 . 
— S. F. Edge , an Englishman , won the James Gordon Bennett Cup in the automobile contest , reaching Innspruck ( Austria ) ahead of his French competitors , including Knyff , who , after leading every one until he was twenty-five miles from Innspruck , broke down . 
This is the first time the cup will leave France . 
Mr. Edge 's time from Paris to Belfort and from Bregenz to Innspruck was 10 hours , 41 minutes , and 58 seconds . 
Baron de Forest arrived at Salzburg ( the third stage of the international race from Paris to Vienna ) first , at 1:34:20 P. M. His average speed from Bregenz to Salzburg was 44 ½ miles per hour . 
Many of the competitors met with slight accidents , owing to the rough condition of the roads . 
The Austrian Emperor ’s brother , Archduke Ludwig , and Archdukes Leopold and Joseph Ferdinand and the local functionaries witnessed the arrival of the racers at Salzburg from the grand stand . 
The very large crowds of spectators gave Baron de Forest an ovation .

NURSES STUCK TO POST 
American Girls Refused to Abandon Charges After Armenian Massacre . 
CONSTANTINOPLE , Aug 12 . 
( Correspondence of Associated Press . ) 
— Two American nurses , Miss Margaret Mack of Hillburn , N. Y. , and Miss Ruth Stuart of New York City , working for the American Commission for Relief in the Near East , declined to abandon the sick and wounded at Shusha , Armenia , after having survived a massacre by Tartars of 700 of the Christian inhabitants of the town , according to a letter just received here by Major David G. Arnold of Providence , R. I. , Director of the commission . 
The letter read : 
" Our doctors and nurses were in the midst of the fight , but were unharmed . 
On advice from General Beach I recalled the two nurses . 
They came reluctantly , and begged to remain at their station , as there was an urgent need for them among the survivors . 
The spirit Miss Mack and Miss Stuart have shown has been splendid , and I felt that they should be allowed to return if they went as volunteers , understanding the serious situation . 
They signed papers to the effect that they knew the danger , and that they were returning to their work at their own request . " April 22 , 1910 . 
Obituary : Mark Twain 
That Samuel L. Clemens was the greatest American humorist of his age nobody will deny . 
Posterity will be left to decide his relative position , in letters among the humorists of English literature . 
It is certain that his contemporary fame abroad was equal to his fame at home . 
All Europe recognized his genius , the English people appreciated him at his own worth , and the University of Oxford honored him with a degree . 
His writings commanded a higher price in the market than those of any other contemporary whose career was solely devoted to literature . 
His " public " was of enormous extent . 
From " The Jumping Frog " to the " Diary of Adam " everything that came from his pen was eagerly read and heartily enjoyed by multitudes . 
Much that he wrote has already been forgotten , inevitably , and in spite of definitive editions and the admirably practical management of his business in the later years of his career . 
But nearly all that Jonathan Swift , Fielding , Sterne , and Smollett wrote has been forgotten , though their fame , resting on a few books , still lives . 
Artemus Ward , Mark Twain 's greatest predecessor as a National jester , is now little more than a name . 
Nasby belonged exclusively to the Reconstruction period . 
For any American humorous writer it would be fit to compare with Mark Twain we must go back to Washington Irving . 
But the author of Knickerbocker 's ironical history and the Sleepy Hollow legend did not surpass , in those denotements of the humorous genius , the author of " The Adventures of a Cub Pilot on the Mississippi " and " Huckleberry Finn . " 
Indeed , it is hard to say that Irving ever surpassed Clemens . 
Without belittling the first great American prose writer we are compelled to doubt if posterity will name him in the same breath with the humorist who has just passed away . 
The " Innocents Abroad " and " A Tramp Abroad " are likely to be remembered among the great travel books of all time . 
Full of the audacity , the wild exaggeration and violent contrasts which distinguish the National humor , they are equally remarkable as the veracious record of fresh impressions on a fertile and responsive mind . 
Mr. Clemens 's more serious works , such as " The Prince and the Pauper , " an incursion into the field of historical romance ; - " A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur , " and " Joan of Arc , " have been read by multitudes with great delight . 
He has been quoted in common conversation oftener , perhaps , than any of his fellow-countrymen , including Benjamin Franklin and Lincoln . 
He has been honored by misquotation , too , and the humorous sayings of the ancients have been attributed to him , though he never borrowed . 
His wit was his own , and so was his extravagance , and his powers of observation never failed him . 
We have called him the greatest American humorist . 
We may leave it an open question whether he was not also the greatest American writer of fiction . 
The creator of Mulberry Sellers and Pudd ' nhead Wilson , the inventor of that Southwestern feud in " Huckleberry Finn , " which , with all its wildly imaginative details , is still infused with rare pathos , has certainly an undying vitality . 
An emotional and quite unconventional sort of man , Clemens was , whose early life was a hard struggle for existence . 
He obtained his education where he could get it . 
Presumably his faults were as large as his merits . 
Intellectually he was of Herculean proportions . 
His death will be mourned , everywhere , and smiles will break through the tears as remembrance of the man 's rich gift to his era comes to the mourners ' minds . 
However his work may be judged by impartial and unprejudiced generations his fame is imperishable . 
January 5 , 1893 
The New Council 
The second municipal election in the history of Edmonton , which took place Tuesday last , was not less important than the first which occurred nearly a year ago . 
It is a mistake to think lightly of the importance of municipal office , or of the responsibilities which are attached to it , either on the part of the citizen , who , as a member of the council , conducts the affairs of the town , or of the citizen who plays the part of taxpayer — and complainant in general . 
There is no question as to the importance of the power of taxation which rests in the council — everyone feels and knows that — and there is as little as to the important effect which the proper or improper application of the taxes so raised has in advancing or retarding the general prosperity of the municipality — but this side of the question is not always as thoroughly understood or appreciated . 
It is a good sign when the heavy taxpayers of the town take an active interest in its public affairs , either by offering themselves for office or by turning out and voting and working for or against the several candidates who may be so offering . 
As to the personal feeling which may enter into a municipal contest nothing need be said . 
It is only fair to say , however , that in the two contests which Edmonton has gone through , personal feeling — either ambition or animosity — played the very smallest part . 
Of the late council it can truthfully be said that it fairly represented the business interests of the town , and of the present one the same may be said an almost equal degree . 
The only fault found with the retiring council was that it was somewhat too liberal in expenditure , and at times somewhat lax in its business methods . 
On the other hand , in taking hold of a town laid out and situated as this was , with everything to do , a liberal expenditure was necessary , and it was not desirable that mere formalities should be allowed to retard the work of improvement . 
Comparing the town as it is to-day with what it was a year ago , it must be admitted that the retiring council did a great deal of very good work , and certainly every member of it exerted himself to the very fullest extent — never stinting his time — in attending to the duties which devolved upon him . 
The first year of a town 's existence is the most critical , for mistakes made then are liable to affect it ever afterwards , and for lack of any foundation to build on mistakes are then most liable to be made . 
Compared with almost any other town in the Northwest Edmonton has come through the first year of its municipal existence very creditably , and to the members of the council who had charge of its affairs during that time full credit is due . 
The incoming council has been elected under most favorable circumstances . 
The mayor and two members of the retiring council have been re-elected , and their experience will be useful in all matters of procedure , saving time and tending to avoid irregularity , and so leaving less room for criticism . 
At the same time a majority of new members have been elected , so that if a change of policy in any particular is felt to be desirable it is possible to effect it . 
There is no doubt that the new members have been elected on the idea that they will secure a more economical efficiency in the municipal service . 
This is always desirable , and in their efforts in this direction they will have the support of every taxpayer . 
But there are two or three questions immediately facing them which must be dealt with on other grounds than those of mere economy . 
The first of these is the ferry matter . 
With the coming spring the control of ferries on the river opposite the town limits devolves upon the town . 
To arrange for the running of these ferries so that they shall not be an undue burden upon the town treasury , and at the same time so that travel shall have the greatest possible facility , as the business interests of the place requires , is a duty which will require the greatest delicacy , and tact in its discharge . 
The bridge question is also up , not simply for discussion , but for action , and also the question of securing an adequate supply of water for fire protection purposes in the business part of town . 
These are matters which must be dealt with , in one way or another — which will not be ignored . 
Upon the ability with which they — especially the bridge matter — are handled , depends very greatly the future of the place .
