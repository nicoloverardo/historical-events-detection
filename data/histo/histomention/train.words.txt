GENOA , February 19th . 
Your most interesting letter , Sir Philosopher , reached me at Gibraltar , and served to give me a homelike feeling in that alien land of Spain . 
Any one who can write letters as interesting as yours , from your library , with the mercury at zero outside , and nothing more refreshing to look upon from the window than snow and sleet , does not need to wander in sunny lands and among ancient ruins for an inspiration . 
No , travel would be absolutely wasted upon you , who require only a cigar and a wood fire to encourage your " reveries of a bachelor . " 
You wish to know what are my first impressions of Italy , and how we three women get on together ? 
To be perfectly candid with you , we ourselves are not wandering in sunny lands at present , and the cheerful blaze of your library fire would prove most welcome to benumbed fingers and pinched noses . 
Our welcome to Genoa was not particularly cheerful . 
It had been raining for days ; the sky was heavy with clouds , and the air chilly and damp . 
We can well understand why the prudent and all-informing Baedeker advises invalids visiting Genoa at this time to guard against raw winds and abrupt changes of temperature . 
We enjoyed coming into the fine harbor , around which Genoa is built upon its hills and terraces in the form of a half-circle , the city widening out toward the ends of the arc . 
On the hills , we know , are many beautiful villas , seen to-day but dimly through veils of mist , and beyond are the mountains , which in clear weather must add much to the charm of this old fortress as seen from the sea . 
Zelphine says that it would be very ungrateful of us if we were to complain of cloudy weather , as the skies might be pouring down upon us instead of only threatening , and , after all , we are having the same good luck that we had in Madeira , Granada , and Algiers in coming after the rain instead of before it . 
And how do we get on together ? 
Really , monsieur , you display courage when you ask that question , as I might here and now unburden my mind of a long list of grievances . 
As it is , however , I have so far no woes to relate , although I know that a sojourn on the Continent has wrecked many a friendship . 
We three must appear to those who meet us an ill-assorted trio ; but because of our individualities we may be the better fitted to stand the crucial test of a tour of indefinite length , whose only object is pleasure . 
Zelphine is the encyclopædia of the party , and , as Angela says , her information is always on tap , besides which she is amiable and refreshingly romantic . 
It is inspiring to travel with a woman , no longer young , to whom the world and its inhabitants still wear " the glory and the dream . " 
On the other hand , when one is suffering from the discomforts of travel to such an extent that it would be a luxury to moan and groan a bit and find fault with the general condition of things , it is a trifle irritating to see Zelphine sailing serenely upon the seas of high content , apparently above such trifling accidents as material comfort . 
You , being a man and consequently a philosopher of greater or less degree , may not be able to understand this ; it is just here that Zelphine and I might quarrel , but we " generally most always " do not . 
Angela you have scarcely known since she was a little girl , when she was a prime favorite of yours . 
In the half-hour in which you saw her , just before we sailed , you must have realized that in appearance she had fulfilled the promise of her beautiful childhood . 
She is a spirited creature , but with a fine balance of common sense , and with her delicate , spirituelle beauty is astonishingly practical - an up-to-date girl , in fine . 
Have you ever wondered , among your many ponderings , why the girls of to-day , with the beauty of their great-grandmothers , should be utterly devoid of the sentiment that enhanced the loveliness of those dear ladies as perfume adds to the charm of a flower ? 
This question I leave with you for future solution . 
Here in Genoa we meet the narrow , precipitous passages , streets by courtesy , which interested us in the Moorish quarter of Algiers , dating back in both cases to remote antiquity . 
They are to be found , we are told , in every old Italian town . 
Many of them answer to Hawthorne 's description of the streets of Perugia , which , he says , are " like caverns , being arched all over and plunging down abruptly towards an unknown darkness , which , when you have fathomed its depths , admits you to a daylight that you scarcely hoped to behold again . " 
Old palaces overshadow these narrow , crooked streets , built many stories high and close together for protection against enemies without and factional feuds at home ; such as those between the powerful houses of Doria , Spinola , Fieschi , and the like . 
The majority of these buildings have fallen from their ancient glory , and look , as Angela says , like tenement houses . 
This plebeian association is carried out by the squalid appearance of the inhabitants , and by the clothes-lines stretched across the streets from window to window , on which are hung garments of every size , degree , color , and ingenuity of patch , the predominant red and white lending a certain picturesqueness to the motley array . 
Turning a corner , we suddenly found ourselves in the midst of a quarrel , or a violent altercation at the best , between a pretty signora at a fourth-floor window and a vendor of fruits and vegetables on the sidewalk below . 
The language which the lady used , as she leaned far out of the window , was so vigorous that no interpreter was needed to make her meaning plain : the merchant was a charlatan and a villain ; the saints were all called upon as witnesses to his depravity . 
He , the so-called vendor of over-ripe fruit , pointed to his wares , beating his breast and spreading out his hands in token of his spotless innocence . 
He sell over-ripe oranges ? 
All his neighbors would testify to his poverty and that of his family because he , honest one , daily sacrificed hundreds of oranges to satisfy his unreasonable customers ! 
The signora 's dark eyes flashed , the Spanish mantilla upon her head shook in sympathy with the violence of her emotions , as she repeated her vocabulary of epithets . 
We were thankful that four stories separated the combatants , and retiring under the shadow of a doorway we anxiously awaited results . 
Something happened , we know not what ; the fruit may have been reduced the fraction of a penny ; whatever it was , a truce was declared , during which the signora 's basket , filled with fruit and artichokes , was drawn up to the window by a rope . 
After the lady had carefully inspected each individual fruit and vegetable , she smiled blandly , lowered some money in her basket , and the pair parted with bows and compliments . 
Juliet on her balcony could not have been more graceful , nor Romeo on the pavement below more gallant than this shabby venditore , as he swept the ground with his cap , one hand upon his heart ! 
Feeling that we owed something to somebody for the pleasure that this little drama had afforded us , we crossed the street and bought from the chief actor some fresh dates such as we had first tasted in Algiers . 
As we paid the asking price without protest , we felt quite sure that the valiant little merchant was making off us anything that he may have lost in his previous transaction ; but the dates , of a delicate amber color , as sweet as honey and almost as transparent , were worth whatever price we paid for them . 
After much turning and retracing of steps , and laughing over being lost and not having the power to make inquiries with any certainty of being understood , we finally gained wider and more open streets , and on the Piazza Banchi found an exchange , where we were able to get some money on our letters of credit . 
After attending to this practical detail we turned into the little old Via Orefici , Jewellers ' Street , with its many goldsmiths ' shops . 
Over one of the doors is a Virgin and Child , so beautiful that it cost the artist his life . 
Pellegrino Piola 's master , insanely jealous of this work of his pupil , rose up in wrath and killed him . 
Even the patron , St. Eloy , was unable to save poor Piola 's life , but the guild of smiths , who revere St. Eloy as their patron saint , invoked his aid to preserve this lovely fresco from the ruthless hands of Napoleon when he would have carried it off to France . 
As we passed window after window , some with their display of exquisite gold and silver filigree and others containing lofty pyramids of the most delicious-looking candied fruit , Angela said that after a few hours ' stay in Genoa she was quite sure of two characteristics of the Genoese : a passion for jewelry , especially of the filigree sort , and an inordinate appetite for sweets . 
The pretty , delicate ornaments , I am inclined to think , are only spread forth to tempt the unwary tourist ; but the Italian taste for sweets is proverbial , whetted , doubtless , by the high price of sugar and the exquisiteness of the native confections . 
Strolling along the fine , wide Via Vittorio Emanuele , eating our dates like true Bohemians and gazing about us upon the sights of the strange city , we turned , almost involuntarily , into the busy thoroughfare of the Via San Lorenzo , where we were confronted by the great façade of the cathedral of the same name , with huge stone lions standing guard at the door . 
Above the entrance - grewsome and realistic spectacle - is poor St. Lawrence broiling away on his stone gridiron ! 
We shall doubtless behold many such spectacles during our travels , and may , like Mark Twain , become quite hardened to the sight of St. Sebastian stuck full of arrows , and of lovely young St. Anastasia and of many others , of whom the world was not worthy , smiling amid the flames ; but this realistic thrusting of St. Lawrence and his gridiron into the life of to-day , as an ornament to a church , impressed us as unworthy of a people credited with a sense of beauty and fitness . 
We were thankful to turn from the cathedral , whose interior we may explore to-morrow , and , like good Americans , wend our way along the Via Balbi , with its many palaces and handsome university buildings , to a lovely little square called Acquaverde , where there is a handsome modern statue of Columbus . 
Beside the really fine figure of the Genoese navigator is a woman who represents either Columbia or an Italianized American Indian , we were not sure which , to whom Columbus is offering the Catholic religion and other blessings of civilization . 
From the benevolent expression of the donor it is evident that he is making the presentation in good faith , although the lady appears singularly indifferent to the gifts offered her . 
Some children with large , dark eyes and round , rosy cheeks , beautiful enough to serve as models for the Holy Child and St. John , were playing in the little green square some rhymed game in which their high , clear voices rang out joyously . 
It was probably an Italian equivalent for " ring-around-the-rosy " or " hot butter-beans . " 
We longed to know just what the words meant . 
Zelphine bribed the singers with soldi to an encore ; but , alas ! 
the song fell upon ears dull of understanding . 
This was the merriest scene that we have found in Genoa , which does not impress us as a gay city at all ; but what mature and sane community could be merry under skies as leaden as these ? 
We are lodged in an old palace , which opens out on those most disappointing arcades of which we have read such fascinating descriptions . 
We see no pretty young Genoese women in thin muslin veils nor handsome matrons in veils of flowered chintz ; probably the rain keeps them and their finery indoors . 
We remind ourselves , from time to time , that we are dwelling in marble halls for the first time in our lives , and yet some of the appointments of this rather expensive albergo are not equal to those of a second or third class hotel in America . 
My room is spacious , with windows opening to the floor and commanding a fine view of the harbor , where many ships lie at anchor , among them the floating city in which we came hither . 
It makes us feel at home to-night to see the lights of the Augusta Victoria , and we wave friendly greetings to her and our fellow-voyagers across the bay . " 
We were far more comfortable in our little state-rooms on the ship than we shall ever be in this damp palace ! " 
said Angela , shivering . " 
This room feels like a cellar . 
Do they never have any fires here ? " " 
Yes , behold the fireplace ! " 
I replied , drawing aside a screen and revealing a small hole in the wall . " 
We will bask in the warmth of a cheerful blaze this evening , and toast our toes before the glowing coals . " 
As luck would have it , the chimney did not draw well , probably not having been used in this century , and so instead of a cheerful blaze we had clouds of smoke , and went to bed to dream of snow-storms and icebergs . 
CHAPTER IV . 
FROM CONSTANTINOPLE TO FLORENCE . 
Goethe quotes Pliny ’s description of Naples , and what Goethe did I surely may be allowed to do . 
Instead , therefore , of trying to describe Naples myself , I will translate what he has quoted : “ So happy , lovely , blessed is that region , that one perceives Nature has rejoiced in her work there . 
Such vital air , such continued salutary clemency of the sky , such fruitful fields , such sunny hills , such innoxious woods , such shady groves , such useful forests , such airy mountains , such far-extending cornfields , such an abundance of vines and olive-trees , such fine wool of the sheep , such fat necks of the oxen , so many lakes , such an abundance of irrigating rivers and streams , so many seas , so many harbours ! 
The earth opens her bosom everywhere to commerce , and , almost anxious to assist man , stretches her arms into the sea . ” 
After reading such a description , the well-known “ Vedi Napoli e poi mori , ” does not seem very exaggerated ; nor when Goethe writes of his father : “ It is said that he who has seen a ghost can never more be joyful , so on the contrary one might have said of him ( his father ) that he could never become quite unhappy , because he thought himself always back again at Naples . ” 
That the days I spent there brought me enjoyment and delight , every one will easily suppose . 
People always call Paris a “ gay ” place , and such no doubt it is , still thousands and thousands lead a dreary and dismal life there , which seems hardly possible in Naples . 
Nature supplies all the necessaries of life in such abundance that even poverty ceases to cause real suffering . 
The climate is so mild that the want of what we should call indispensable clothing brings no discomfort ; while a plate of macaroni , a dried fish , or a slice of melon seems to be all the food they require . 
They are exceedingly fond of music and dancing , and the Neapolitan airs are lively and pretty , and pleased me more than any I have heard in Italy . 
The performers who sing before the hotel , the caffés and restaurants , and accompany their songs with the guitar and the liveliest expression and gesticulations , look delightfully merry and cunning . 
Many of them improvise in a ready , pretty manner . 
Who can be sad and morose in a place like this , where everybody looks smiling , good-natured and contented ? 
To be merry , joyful and happy lies in the air there , and is contagious like an epidemic . 
And I do not think the expression of good-nature and contentment one sees in almost every face , belies their feelings . 
The Neapolitans appeared to be very kind-hearted , and to delight in giving pleasure . 
We received , during our short stay at Naples , several marks of good will from them , of which I remember one especially with pleasure . 
We had stopped , on our way back from a short excursion to Posilipo , at a pretty restaurant , where we took some refreshments on an open platform overlooking the sea . 
While sitting there , and looking at the Bay and all the beauty surrounding it , a boat passed with a merry party in it , four of whom were amateur musicians . 
They played on two guitars , a flute , and a trombone . 
As soon as they saw us they stopped the boat right under our platform and played a pretty Neapolitan air , with the simple intention of giving us pleasure . 
When they had finished they greeted us and left . 
We returned the kind salute , and listened to their “ renewed strain ” till it became indistinct , and the accompanying sounds of the trombone only reached us . 
After the great variety of Eastern costume the dress of the Neapolitans looked rather tame . 
The dress of the women is neat and clean , their full black hair is well plaited and shines like satin ; but they wear nothing that can be called a costume , and I found even crinoline introduced to a great extent . 
If it were not for the dress of the different orders of monks and nuns , of boatmen and fishermen , and here and there a contadina in her pretty dress , the crowd would be not much more picturesque than an English one , from which however it would be easily distinguished by the darker complexion of the people , the animated features , and the lively gesticulations with which they accompany all they say . 
We were at Naples the week after the first Sunday in May , which is one continual festival in honour of St. Gennaro , the great patron saint of Naples . 
Thus I had an opportunity of witnessing the celebrated miracle of liquefaction of the blood of the saint , which is kept in two phials in the chapel “ del Tesoro ” adjoining the cathedral , for the blood liquefies daily during the festival when high mass is celebrated . 
The chapel is wonderfully magnificent ; the three altars with their ornaments , and the statues of more than forty saints , being all of silver . 
The most magnificent of all is , of course , that of Saint Gennaro standing on the high altar , whose mitre of gold is covered with precious stones of great size , and who wears round his neck enough ornaments to deck a whole crowd of queens and duchesses . 
They are the gifts of different kings and queens of Naples . 
Napoleon I. , who stripped so many churches of their treasures , made a present to this all-powerful saint , and Victor Emanuel seems to have thought that in this respect he too must follow the example of his predecessors , for the saint wears two magnificent crosses of amethysts and diamonds , the gift of the Rè Galantuomo . 
My husband did not approve of this , and even expressed a wish that Garibaldi had melted down the gold and silver saints , and invested the money so obtained in schools for the people , and other public and charitable institutions . 
But who can tell if even Garibaldi , the idol of the people of Naples , and the saint they perhaps most adore after St. Gennaro , could have done this . 
The priest to whom I expressed my astonishment , that the treasures of this chapel had escaped the vicissitudes of so many revolutions and wars , said it was evidently a miracle wrought by the saint . 
If the great St. Gennaro has as yet escaped peculation , the common little saints that used to stand at every street corner of Naples , have not fared so well of late . 
They were all of them removed in one night , by order of General La Marmora , then Governor of Naples . 
The people , especially the women , became clamorous and noisy on the discovery next morning , but were told that the Governor was so fond of the Saints , that he wished to take better care of them . 
He had therefore removed the Saints from their uncomfortable quarters in the street , to snugger ones in the Churches and Convents , where they would be much better off . 
This entirely satisfied the crowd . 
The removal of the Saints , and that of the pigs of St. Antonio , which Garibaldi effected , has much changed the appearance of the streets of Naples . 
The pigs of the Convent of St. Antonio , that used to run about in the principal streets of Naples , even in the fine Strada Toledo , and which lived upon public charity , were a terrible nuisance . 
The ignorant populace held these pigs of the holy fathers in great veneration , and fed them well , and I have been assured on good authority , that if a man had with his cart or carriage run over a child in the streets , he might possibly have escaped unpunished , but had he hurt a pig in that way , the infuriated mob would almost have killed him . 
NAPLES , March 7th . 
This whole morning we spent in the Aquarium , which is down near the sea , a part of the Villa Nazionale . 
Here we saw all manner of beautiful and hideous creatures of the deep , some exquisitely colored fish from the Mediterranean , living coral , medusæ , crested blubbers , airy and transparent as soap-bubbles , and the wonderful octopus . 
Angela insisted on seeing these horrible creatures fed , and by the time that important ceremony was over and we had walked through the shaded park enjoying the flowers , which are blooming in profusion everywhere , it was time to go home for our second breakfast . 
We went to Posilipo in the steam tram , this afternoon , and were shown the old Roman columbarium on the hillside , popularly known as the Tomb of Virgil . 
Whether or not the poet was buried there is now disputed by scholars ; however , Zelphine says that Virgil certainly wrote his " Georgics " and " Æneid " in his villa near by , and that Petrarch considered this tomb sufficiently important to plant a laurel here . 
She and I have no patience with the iconoclasts who take so much pleasure in destroying our illusions , and we see no reason why the traveller should not be allowed to weep over this tomb of Virgil , unless , indeed , a more authentic one can be furnished him . 
Later we climbed up to the terraced garden that belongs to the Ristorante Promessi Sposi - fancy an inn at home named The Betrothed ! 
Here we had afternoon tea , while our eyes were feasted with the beauties of a gorgeous sunset . 
Vesuvius , Capri , Ischia , and all the smaller islands of the bay were bathed in heliotrope light , a royal array of purple velvet . 
Buchanan Read 's lines on the Bay of Naples must have been inspired by just such a sea and sky as this . 
Zelphine evidently had the same thought , for she quoted softly : " ' My soul to-day Is far away , Sailing the Vesuvian Bay ; My winged boat , A bird afloat , Swims round the purple peaks remote . ' " 
We should have been in a boat on the purple bay instead of in a tram ! 
I am finishing this letter rather hurriedly for to-night 's mail , as we shall be off to-morrow bright and early for a tour of several days , to Pompeii , La Cava , and Pæstum , returning by the coast drive and stopping at Amalfi and Sorrento . 
It is the sort of excursion that you would enjoy so much - would you like to be of the party ? Sant ' Agata , Sorrento Siren-Land revisited ... . 
A delightful stroll , yesterday , with a wild youngster from the village of Torco - what joy to listen to analphabetics for a change : they are indubitably the salt of the earth - down that well-worn track to Crapolla , only to learn that my friend Garibaldi , the ancient fisherman , the genius loci , has died in the interval ; thence by boat to the lonely beach of Recomone ( sadly noting , as we passed , that the rock-doves at the Grotto delle Palumbe are now all extirpated ) , where , for the sake of old memories , I indulged in a bathe and then came across an object rare in these regions , a fragment of grey Egyptian granite , relic of some pagan temple and doubtless washed up here in a wintry gale ; thence , for a little light refreshment , to Nerano ; thence to that ill-famed " House of the Spirits " where my Siren-Land was begun in the company of one who feared no spirits - victim , already , of this cursed war , but then a laughter-loving child - and down to the bay and promontory of Ierate , there to make the unwelcome discovery that certain hideous quarrying operations on the neighbouring hill have utterly ruined the charm of this once secluded site ; thence laboriously upwards , past that line of venerable goat-caves , to the summit of Mount San Costanzo . 
Nothing has changed . 
The bay of Naples lay at my feet as of old , flooded in sunshine . 
There is a small outdoor cistern here . 
Peering into its darkness through an aperture in the roof , I noticed that there was water at the bottom ; out of the water projected a stone ; on the stone , a prisoner for life , sat the most disconsolate lizard imaginable . 
It must have tumbled through the chink , during some scuffle with a companion , into this humid cell , swum for refuge to that islet and there remained , feeding on the gnats which live in such places . 
I observed that its tail had grown to an inordinate length - from disuse , very likely ; from lack of the usual abrasion against shrubs and stones . 
An unenviable fate for one of these restless and light-loving creatures , never again to see the sun ; to live and die down here , all alone in the dank gloom , chained , as it were , to a few inches of land amid a desolation of black water . 
It took my thoughts back to what I saw two days ago while climbing in the torrid hour of noon up that shadeless path where the vanilla-scented orchids grow - the path which runs from Sant ' Elia past the shattered Natural Arch to Fontanella . 
Here , at the hottest turning of the road , sat a woman in great distress . 
Beside her was a pink pig she had been commissioned to escort down to the farm of Sant ' Elia . 
This beast was suffering hellish torments from the heat and vainly endeavouring , with frenzied grunts of despair , to excavate for itself a hollow in the earth under a thinly clothed myrtle bush . 
I told the woman of shade lower down . 
She said she knew about it , but the pig - the pig refused to move ! 
It had been engaged upon this hopeless occupation , without a moment 's respite , for an hour or more ; nothing would induce it to proceed a step further ; it had plainly made up its mind to find shelter here from the burning rays , or die . 
And of shelter there was none . 
What would not this pig ( I now thought ) have given to be transported into the lizard 's cool aquatic paradise ; and the lizard , into that scorching sunlight ! 
... It was not to muse upon the miseries of the animal creation that I have revisited these shores . 
I came to puzzle once more over the site of that far-famed Athene temple which gave its name to the whole promontory . 
Now , after again traversing the ground with infinite pleasure , I fail to find any reason for changing what I wrote years ago in a certain pamphlet which some scholar , glancing through these pages and anxious to explore for himself a spot of such celebrity in ancient days , is so little likely to see that he may not be sorry if I here recapitulate its arguments . 
Others will be well advised to pass over what follows . 
Let me begin by saying that the temple , in every probability , stood at the Punta Campanella facing Capri , the actual headland of the Sorrentine peninsula , where - apart from every other kind of evidence - you may pick up to this day small terra-cotta figures of Athene , made presumably to be carried away as keepsakes by visitors to the shrine . 
Now for alternative suggestions . 
Strabo tells us that the temple was placed on the akron of the promontory ; that is , the summit of Mount San Costanzo where we are now standing . 
( He elsewhere describes it as being " on the straits . " ) 
This summit is nearly 500 metres above the sea-level , and here no antique building seems ever to have been erected . 
No traces of old life are visible save some fragments of Roman pottery which may have found their way up in early Byzantine days , even as modern worshippers carry up the ephemeral vessels popularly called " caccavelle " and scatter them about . 
With the exception of one fragment of white Pentelic marble , no materials of an early period have been incorporated into the masonry of the little chapel or the walls of the fields below . 
It is incredible that no vestige of a structure like the Athene temple should remain on a spot of this kind , so favourably situated as regards immunity from depredations , owing to its isolated and exalted position . 
The rock-surface around the summit has not undergone that artificial levelling which an edifice of this importance would necessitate ; the terrace is of mediaeval construction , as can be seen by its supporting walls . 
No doubt the venerable Christian sanctuary there has been frequently repaired and modified ; on the terrace-level to the south can be seen the foundations of an earlier chapel , and the slopes are littered with broken bricks , Sorrentine tufa , and old battuto floors . 
But there is no trace of antique workmanship or material , nor has the rocky path leading up to the shrine been demarcated with chisel-cuts in the ancient fashion . 
The sister-summit of La Croce is equally unproductive of classical relics . 
We must therefore conclude that Strabo was mistaken . 
And why not ? 
His accounts of many parts of the Roman world are surprisingly accurate , but , according to Professor Pais , " of Italy Strabo seems to have known merely the road which leads from Brindisi to Rome , the road between Rome and Naples and Pozzuoli , and the coast of Etruria between Rome and Populonia . " 
If so , he probably saw no more of the district than can be seen from Naples . 
He attributes the foundation of this Athene temple to Odysseus : statements of such a kind make one wonder whether the earlier portions of his lost history were more critical than other old treatises which have survived . 
So much for Strabo . 
Seduced by a modern name , which means nothing more or less than " a temple " - strong evidence , surely - I was inclined to locate the Athene shrine at a spot called Ierate ( marked also as Ieranto on some maps , and popularly pronounced Ghiérate the Greek aspirate still surviving ) which lies a mile or more eastwards of the Punta Campanella and faces south . " 
Hieron , " I thought : that settles it . 
You may guess I was not a little proud of this discovery , particularly when it turned out that an ancient building actually did stand there - on the southern slope , namely , of the miniature peninsula which juts into Ierate bay . 
Here I found fragments of antique bricks , tegulae bipedales , amphoras , pottery of the lustrous Sorrentine ware - Surrentina bibis ? 
- pavements of opus signinum , as well as one large Roman paving flag of the type that is found on the road between Termini and Punta Campanella . 
( How came this stone here ? 
Did the old road from Stabiae Athene temple go round the promontory and continue as far as Ierate along the southern slope of San Costanzo hill ? 
No road could pass there now ; deforestation has denuded the mountain-side of its soil , laying bare the grey rock - a condition at which its mediaeval name of Mons Canutarius already hints . ) 
Well , a more careful examination of the site has convinced me that I was wrong . 
No temple of this magnificence can have stood here , but only a Roman villa - one of the many pleasure-houses which dotted these shores under the Empire . 
So much for myself . 
PEUTINGER 'S CHART Showing ancient road rounding the headland and terminating at " Templum Minervae . " 
None the less - and this is a really curious point - an inspection of Peutinger 's Tables seems to bear out my original theory of a temple at Ierate . 
For the structure is therein marked not at the Punta Campanella but , approximately , at Ierate itself , facing south , with the road from Stabiae over Surrentum rounding the promontory and terminating at the temple 's threshold . 
Capri and the Punta Campanella are plainly drawn , though not designated by name . 
Much as I should like my first speculation to be proved correct on the evidence of this old chart of A.D. 226 , I fear both of us are mistaken . 
So much for Peutinger 's Tables . 
Beloch makes a further confusion in regard to the local topography . 
He says that the " three-peaked rock " which Eratosthenes describes as separating the gulfs of Cumae and Paestum ( that is , of Naples and Salerno ) is Mount San Costanzo . 
I do not understand Beloch falling into this error , for the old geographer uses the term skopelos , which is never applied to a mountain of this size , but to cliffs projecting upon the sea . 
Moreover , the landmark is there to this day . 
I have not the slightest doubt that Eratosthenes meant the pinnacle of Ierate , which is three-peaked in a remarkably , and even absurdly , conspicuous manner , both when viewed from the sea and from the land ( from the chapel of S. M. della Neve , for instance ) . 
Now this projecting cliff of three peaks - they are called , respectively , Montalto , Ierate , and Mortella ; Ierate for short - is not the actual boundary between the two gulfs ; not by a mile or more . 
No ; but from certain points it might well be mistaken for it . 
The ancients had no charts like ours , and the world in consequence presented itself differently to their senses ; even Strabo , says Bunbury , " was so ignorant of the general form and configuration of the North African coast as to have no clear conception of the great projection formed by the Carthaginian territory and the deep bay to the east of it " ; and , coasting along the shore line , this triple-headed skopelos , behind which lies the inlet of Ierate , might possibly be mistaken for the turning-point into the gulf of Naples . 
So it looks when viewed from the S.E. of Capri ; so also from the Siren islets - a veritable headland . 
So much for Beloch and Eratosthenes . 
To sum up : Strabo is wrong in saying that the temple of Athene stood on the summit of Mount San Costanzo ; I was wrong in thinking that this temple lay at Ierate ; Peutinger 's Chart is wrong in figuring the structure on the south side of the Sorrentine peninsula ; Beloch is wrong in identifying the skopelos trikoruphos of Eratosthenes with Mount San Costanzo ; Eratosthenes is wrong in locating his rock at the boundary between the two gulfs . 
The shrine of Athene lay doubtless at Campanella , whose crag is of sufficient altitude to justify Roman poets like Statius in their descriptions of its lofty site . 
So great a number of old writers concur in this opinion - Donnorso , Persico , Giannettasio , Mazzella , Anastasio , Capaccio - that their testimony would alone be overwhelming , had these men been a little more careful as to what they called a " temple . " 
Capasso , the acutest modern scholar of these regions , places it " in the neighbourhood of the Punta Campanella . " 
Professor Pais , in 1900 , wrote a paper on this " Atene Siciliana " which I have not seen . 
The whole question is discussed in Filangieri 's recent history of Massa ( 1908-1910 ) . 
It also occurs to me that Strabo 's term akron may mean an extremity or point projecting into the sea ( a sense in which Homer used it ) , and be applicable , therefore , to the Punta Campanella . 
CAVA DEI TIRRENI , March 9th . 
I opened my windows this morning and stepped out on the marble terrace to enjoy a view of the mountains , which had looked so enchanting by moonlight and were no less beautiful by day . 
In the garden below a blue gown flitting about among the orange-trees attracted my attention . 
Angela had evidently brought her charms to bear upon the heart of the padrone , as I heard him say , " Here are scissors for the signorina to cut all the oranges she wishes . 
In the signorina 's own country the oranges do not grow up to the doorstep as with us . 
Is it not so ? " " 
No , indeed , " said Angela , deftly snipping off a golden ball . " 
This is a great pleasure . 
I never cut an orange from a tree but once in my life , and that was in Granada . " 
Being possessed of an inquiring turn of mind , the padrone asked many questions concerning Granada , and so talking and working industriously Angela soon collected a fine dish of oranges for our breakfast - an unwonted luxury , as in this land of abundance they never give us fruit for our early déjeuner . 
The carriages were at the door before we had finished our breakfast , and in ours , as though in answer to our desires , sat Mrs. Coxe , provided with a guide-book , lorgnette , lunch , and all the equipment of a good traveller for a long day 's drive . 
The proprietor announced that he would accompany us as far as Salerno , occupying the seat on the box beside the driver and his little brother . 
Mrs. Coxe evidently considered this her opportunity for informing herself with regard to the country , its inhabitants , and its productions . 
She had added not a little to her already large store of information , gained in many lands , when the padrone , to our great regret , left us , with many bows , smiles , and wishes for a " bel giro . " 
We had the very tip-top of the morning for the beginning of our drive , as we set forth at eight o'clock . 
The air is soft and clear like that of a May day at home . 
We can scarcely believe that it is March , and that our friends across the water are still in the grasp of winter , as we left all that behind us when we sailed from New York six weeks ago . 
[ Illustration : On the Road to Paestum ] Our way lay between green meadows dotted with purple cyclamen and a small yellow flower much like the English primrose , and in some places through groves of orange-trees covered with golden fruit . 
Fortunately for those who take this long drive , the roads are excellent . 
We drove slowly through the old town of Cava , with its narrow , precipitous streets , and through Salerno , which is upon a bluff overlooking the bay , and commands a noble panorama of sea and shore . 
When , however , we reached the plain , our horses set forth at a brisk pace . 
There was not much to be seen here except acres of fennel , artichoke , and a bean , now covered with white blossoms , which I believe is used chiefly for feeding the cattle . 
Even this road through a flat country is not without a touch of picturesqueness , as it is in many places bordered by gnarled sycamores twisted into the most weird and grotesque shapes . 
Between these trees a peasant woman was walking , bearing upon her head an immense brush-heap , which was probably her winter firewood . 
Zelphine and Angela had their kodaks with them , of course , and begged the driver to stop and allow them to get a snap-shot , which he did , crying out , " Ecco , ecco , signora ! " 
The woman stopped obediently , and stood like a statue , in a natural pose full of grace and strength . 
She was evidently pleased to have her picture taken , as these peasants always are , especially if a few soldi are thrown in to seal the contract . 
If the picture is good you shall have one , as it will give you a characteristic bit of this Southern Italian life . 
Here women young and old are to be seen working in the fields with the men , driving ox-carts , walking beside them , and bearing burdens that seem far too heavy for any woman 's shoulders . 
Although the land seems fertile , the people are evidently very poor , the villages small , and the houses comfortless . 
We should have liked to ask the driver some questions about the products of the soil , the peasants , and their lives , but neither he nor his little brother , who was on the box beside him , adapted themselves gracefully to the restrictions of our vocabulary - there is , we find , a great difference in drivers in this respect . 
At Battipaglia , a railroad station and the most considerable town on the route , we changed horses and drivers also . 
This latter substitution we found was to our advantage , as the second vetturino proved to be a better linguist than his predecessor , which enabled us to continue our interrupted studies in agriculture and political economy . 
The new driver was serviceable also in other respects . 
When we came upon a field of narcissus , he stopped the carriage in order to allow us the pleasure of gathering the fragrant blossoms , besides bringing us handfuls of flowers , the largest bunch of course being laid at Angela 's feet . 
We are quite sure that he considers her the living image of the pictures of the Blessed Virgin , although he is too discreet to say so . 
Angela was charming to-day , in a blue suit and a white shirt-waist , but the March sun was so hot that by the time we reached Pæstum it had taken all the color out of the crown of her pretty blue hat . 
As there is no inn at Pæstum we ate our luncheon by the roadside , stopping under the shade of a tree where a peasant was enjoying his siesta , his oxen being tethered near by . 
Zelphine is enthusiastic over the beauty of these gentle creatures , with their soft , kindly brown eyes , and says that she is sure that Homer , when he wrote of his ox-eyed maidens , had just such a one in mind as she was feeding from her hand . 
She made so pretty a picture as she stood beside the great white ox , feeding him daintily with bean-blossoms , that Angela tried to get a snap-shot of her , but that provoking ox - the slowest of all animals - took it into his head to move at the critical moment . 
The country seemed more level and marshy as we drew near Pæstum , although on the left there rose the spur of a mountain range , on one of whose heights are the ruins of the hillside fortress of Capaccio Vecchio . 
This town was founded by the inhabitants of Pæstum when they were driven from their city by the Saracens in the ninth century . 
To our surprise , we saw herds of buffalo grazing in the fields , much smaller and different in other respects from the American bison . 
Our driver told us that this small black buffalo is to be found near the coast in many parts of Italy , and is often seen on the Campagna near Rome . 
From the number of calves in some of the fields we are inclined to think that the young buffaloes are used for food . 
I noticed several of the well-grown animals drawing carts , sometimes harnessed with the white oxen . 
We caught a glimpse of the old wall and gate with the sea beyond , and then in a moment the temples were in full view . 
Nothing could be more impressive than those magnificent ruins on that lonely plain , sharply outlined against the blue sky . 
The Temple of Neptune , with its thirty-six fluted Doric columns , its double columns inside , and its noble , almost perfect façade , is a superb example of Greek architecture of the fifth century B.C . 
The stone of which the temple is built is a kind of travertine , to which the passing years have imparted a creamy , mellow tone . 
The Temple of Ceres is less complete than that dedicated to Neptune , although it belongs to the same period . 
The gate of the town opening out toward the sea and the old wall adjoining it are wonderfully preserved . 
These with the temples of Neptune and Ceres and the so-called Basilica are all that remain of this settlement made by Greeks from Sybaris about 600 B.C. Two days we have passed with the ancients , yesterday in a city where " the earth , with faithful watch , has hoarded all , " and to-day in a town not much older than Pompeii , where the conquering Saracens and Normans and the devastating elements have left nothing to tell the tale of the daily life and habits of the Greeks who made their home upon these shores . 
We climbed over the ruins of the old temples and sat upon the town wall overlooking the sea , while Angela made a fairly good sketch of the temples . 
Zelphine and I bought coins and pottery from children who , being without visible habitation , seemed to have literally sprung from the soil . 
Finally our vetturino warned us that we had better set forth at once if we wished to reach Cava before nightfall . 
At Battipaglia we resumed our former horses and driver . 
Zelphine whispered something to me about his face being rather red . 
I quite agreed with her , but as the mention of the fact could not be of any especial advantage , the other carriage being already far in advance and no person at hand to take the reins , there was nothing to do but to set forth on our homeward journey , despite some misgivings upon Zelphine 's part and mine . 
We had not left Battipaglia before I realized that our gravest fears were fulfilled . 
Our driver was what you men picturesquely call " gloriously drunk " - we practical women would use a less dignified adverb . 
He was as happy as a lord , cracking his whip and dashing through the streets of Battipaglia in fine style . 
We soon passed the other coach , containing Mrs. Coxe 's friends . 
They called after us , but must have seen that we had no time for conversation en route ; indeed , like Cowper 's citizen " of credit and renown , " we passed everything on the road . 
Zelphine and I were on the front seat , facing Mrs. Coxe and Angela . 
They , happily , did not grasp the situation at once , but when they did the terror written on that dear old lady 's face was something never to be forgotten . 
Angela , with resolute cheerfulness , chatted away about anything and everything , especially about Mrs. Coxe 's experiences in Honolulu , her favorite subject of conversation . 
I shall never hear of that island kingdom of the Pacific without seeing before me Mrs. Coxe 's agonized face . 
Remembering that there lay before us a long stretch of road overhanging a sharp declivity , Zelphine and I made a desperate attempt to stop our hilarious vetturino in his mad career . 
Finding that our remonstrances excited him to more strenuous exertions , Zelphine tried the effect of her few available words and many eloquent gestures upon the small boy , urging him to make his brother drive more carefully , telling him that the old lady of the party was very much alarmed , and advising him to get the whip into his own hands . 
This , however , proved to be impossible ; the boy , well frightened himself by this time , only succeeded in getting hard words and a shaking . 
Give up his whip ! 
Not he . 
As well ask a soldier to lay down his arms . 
The whip was his pride and joy , his pièce de résistance , so to speak , with which he awoke the echoes of these slumbering old Italian towns , bringing the inhabitants , men , women , children , cats , dogs , and chickens , to the sidewalk to witness our rapid transit . 
Even those among our own countrymen who pride themselves most upon their skill in annihilating space could not have made better time than we did as we rattled over that Calabrian highway . 
Fortunately , the horses were well-trained and steady enough to balance the driver 's eccentricities . 
Perhaps they were accustomed to them by long experience . 
Be this as it may , we proceeded on our way without any accident , passing the dangerous part of the road before darkness overtook us . 
We clattered through Salerno at a tearing gallop , and as we neared La Cava the whip-cracking was resumed with renewed vigor , bringing the citizens to their doors and windows . 
Some of them , indeed , followed the carriage , crying out , " Prima donna ! 
Prima donna ! " " 
What can they mean ? " 
asked Mrs. Coxe , looking as though she expected to be attacked by a furious mob . 
Zelphine reminded her that as we drove by the theatre in the morning we had noticed a poster announcing that a grand opera was to be given in Cava that evening . 
In our gay morning spirits we had even thought that it might be pleasant to assist at the function . 
Now the most that we dared to hope was that we might reach the hotel in safety . 
Troops of children ran after us , repeating the shout of " Prima donna ! 
Prima donna ! " " 
We are honored by being mistaken for a part of the opera troupe , " said Zelphine , laughing , " and Angela is evidently the leading lady , as they are all looking at her . " 
Angela , sitting erect on the back seat , her costume as crisp and immaculate as if she were on her way to a horse-show , her jaunty hat at the most stylish angle even if the crown was off color , looked indeed like a leading lady , albeit a trifle pale and in need of the aid of the rouge-pot of the greenroom . 
When we reached our hotel we were all exhausted by the fatigue of the day and the long strain of the afternoon ; but Mrs. Coxe showed herself the thorough-going traveller that she is by stopping not for rest or refreshment until she had laid a detailed account of our experiences before the proprietor . 
He came to us later , after a visit to the driver 's home , and reported him as covered with confusion and filled with remorse . " 
Ecco , ecco , he is the penitent one now ! " 
exclaimed the padrone . " 
His parents have scolded him soundly , and have threatened to beat him with a stick . 
He is in tears , the sorrowful one ! 
It is the first time , and it will never happen again ! " " 
All of which would not mend our bones if they had been broken ! " 
said Mrs. Coxe , stoutly . " 
It is your duty to give your patrons good , safe drivers . " 
The padrone then called upon the saints to witness to the fact that he had never known an accident to befall any of his patrons , repeating that this was Antonio 's first offence , and that he must have been drinking some bad stuff at the tavern , as good wine would never so set the brain on fire . 
The proprietor has a frank manner that gives one the impression that he is speaking the truth ; we are inclined to believe him , although we have been warned not to allow ourselves to be deceived by appearances in this land of ready eloquence . 
Our valiant countrywoman having made her protest for the party , and this disagreeable duty having been taken off our shoulders , we went into dinner with high spirits and famous appetites . 
Zelphine and I are so wide awake after our exciting drive that we are devoting the evening to letter-writing , both of us being sadly in arrears . 
The other guests of the Hotel S. have betaken themselves to their slumbers , and we enjoy undisturbed possession of the only warm room in the house . 
A wood fire blazes on the hearth , and as we bask in its genial warmth we shiver at the thought of our rooms upstairs , which , with their stone floors , are of about the temperature of refrigerators . 
SORRENTO , March 11th . 
We left Cava on Wednesday , and made the tour from there to Amalfi in the brilliant morning sunshine . 
This is another " Cornice Drive , " and far finer , I think , than that along the Riviera . 
The road winds above , beneath , and beside rugged cliffs of great height , always with the sea in full view . 
Often from airy summits we looked down upon fishing villages and towns built around bays and inlets , as Cetara and Atrani , while upon projecting headlands are many watch-towers , now used chiefly as dwellings . 
We needed not to be told that the making of macaroni is one of the chief industries of Amalfi . 
As we drew near the town many yards of it were to be seen hanging upon lines like a wash or spread upon the grass to dry . 
Amalfi is charmingly situated at the entrance to a deep ravine , surrounded by mountains and rocks of the most picturesque forms . 
We climbed up the sixty steps of the Cathedral of St. Andrew . 
Mrs. Coxe and some of her party were carried up in chairs by two stout Calabrians , but we preferred to walk , turning every now and then to gaze upon the enchanting view spread before us . 
At the top of the slope is a spacious garden terrace full of flowers , with roses climbing all over its walls . 
We stopped overnight at the old Capuchin monastery , which is now fitted up as a hotel , and yesterday drove here , the greater part of the way beside terraces of lemon-trees covered with ripening fruit - enough lemons to make lemonade for the whole world , one would think . 
As we drew near Sorrento orange-trees took the place of lemon-trees , groves and groves of them , with their dark , shining leaves and brilliantly colored fruit . 
Peasants brought oranges to the carriage for sale , clusters of them , with fruit and blossoms growing together , which they were glad to give us for a few soldi . 
This morning we spent in the shops buying wood-carvings and silk , which is made here , and is consequently astonishingly cheap . 
We found Mr. Crawford 's charming villa , and , to Zelphine 's great delight , the house of Tasso 's sister on the Strada San Nicola . 
Tasso 's birthplace and the rock upon which the house stood have both been swallowed up by the sea ; but the house of his sister Cornelia , to which the great Tasso came in 1592 disguised as a shepherd , is still standing , and there is a statue of Torquato Tasso in the chief square of Sorrento . 
[ Illustration : An Amazonian Tribute , Capri ] I am writing on a fine terrace overlooking the sea , where stone benches and tables are conveniently arranged for our use . 
The sun is like that of June , and roses such as belong to that month are blooming all over the wall beside me . 
The concierge has just brought me a handful of them , charming pink and white ones . 
We are equipped for a drive to the Deserto , which Mrs. Coxe , who visited the place forty years ago , tells us is most interesting . 
Within a few years the monastery has been suppressed , and the building is now used as a home for destitute children . 
We should like to spend a week in Sorrento , which is so beautiful itself and from which so many excursions are to be made ; but Capri beckons to us from across the bay and our time is limited , as Zelphine has promised to meet some cousins in Naples . 
CAPRI , March 13th . 
Our reception on the island of the Blue Grotto was sufficiently novel to please the most blasé traveller . 
As our boat drew near the rocky shore dozens of women , most of them young and handsome , hurried down to the wharf and seized our luggage , which they bore on their heads easily and lightly up the steep path to the hotel . 
It seemed strange enough to have women carry our dress-suit-cases and bags , but on our way to the hotel we saw a much more unusual sight - three women carrying two trunks and a valise , while a man , evidently the owner of the trunks , was walking quite at his ease beside them . 
He was , we were told later , a Caprian peasant on his way to America , and this delicate attention was a final act of devotion on the part of his Amazonian countrywomen . 
Capri has not been as kind to us as other towns of Southern Italy . 
The mountains have had their heads buried in clouds all the morning , and when the donkeys arrived which we had ordered for a ride up to the Villa of Tiberius , a fine rain was falling , which prevented us from making the excursion . 
We sent the donkeys and their women drivers home , much to the disappointment of the latter . " 
Women seem to do everything here ! " 
said Angela . " 
Where are the men ? " " 
Gone to America , " replied Mrs. Coxe , quickly . " 
The women ship them off , bag and baggage , and then have everything their own way . " 
Fortune favored us later in the day , as the clouds rolled off the mountains before noon , and the padrone informed us that the wind was in the right quarter for a visit to the Blue Grotto . 
We made our expedition satisfactorily , although the sea was high and we literally rode the waves in our small boats . 
The grotto is quite as blue as any picture of it that I have ever seen , and with an exquisite , luminous transparency that no brush or pencil can portray . 
When we were in the midst of the silvery blueness , watching with some apprehension a small boy who dives into the water to show off its wonderful color , our boatman suddenly became loquacious , and told us thrilling tales of unfortunate visitors to the grotto who had been walled in by the sea and were obliged to spend days and even weeks in this drear abode , living upon supplies which daring sailors , who contrived to get their boats near to the mouth of the grotto , handed in to them . 
The smallness of the opening of the grotto gave a semblance of reality to these Münchausen tales . 
Mrs. Coxe , who was in the boat with me , became very much alarmed and insisted upon leaving at once , calling to the other members of the party to follow . 
We were splashed a little by the spray as we emerged from the grotto , and those in the other boats were quite wet ; but as we rowed away the mouth of the fairy cave was almost hidden by the waves . 
It seemed indeed as if there might be a grain of truth in the boatman 's tales , which the padrone corroborated , adding , " But it does not often happen that travellers are shut up for any time in the Grotta Azzurra ; we are very careful . " " 
Not very often indeed ! 
As if once would not be enough ! " 
exclaimed Mrs. Coxe , who had interrogated the padrone after her straightforward fashion of getting at the truth of the matter . 
HOTEL B. , NAPLES , March 15th . 
We are glad to be in Naples again , and in this homelike hotel . 
Zelphine has met her cousins , and has been making some excursions with them , taking the famous drive to the monastery of Camaldoli and to the Solfatara , a half-extinct volcano which , she says , gives one an even more impressive idea of the Inferno than the Doré illustrations of Dante . 
Angela corroborated Zelphine 's report , saying that it was quite the most unpleasant place she had ever seen , especially as they dropped a poor dog into the crater to try the effects of the sulphur upon his constitution . 
They pulled him out before he was quite dead ; but who except these cruel Neapolitans would so persecute a helpless animal ? 
I , with my old habit of clinging to the skirts of the things I already know , declined to take that excursion , for the greater pleasure of spending a morning in the National Museum among the Pompeian treasures and another whole day among the ruins of the buried city . 
It is really much more interesting to examine the relics from Pompeii after one has been there , as one naturally fits the frescoes , furniture , and ornaments into just such rooms as one has seen . 
Some of the furniture was strangely modern ; I noticed a red and gilt bedstead that looked as if it might have belonged to the First French Empire , rather than to the first century A.D. Among the kitchen furnishings were just such colanders , saucepans , and skillets as we use to-day - is there anything really new under this shining sun ? 
The surgical and dental instruments exhibited in one of the cases caused me a genuine thrill of sympathy for those unhappy Pompeians ; to have been smothered with hot ashes might really have been more endurable than to have lived at the mercy of those primitive dentists and surgeons ! 
We leave Naples to-morrow with regret , as we have grown very fond of this beautiful city . 
I wrote a week since to Ludovico Baldini , and also to the proprietor of a hotel that he recommended to me ; but I have heard from neither . 
Ludovico may be in Florence on some army business , but it is very stupid of the proprietor of the Hotel L. not to answer my letter . 
We have telegraphed for rooms in a pension on the Via Sistina , which Mrs. Coxe tells us is delightful , and we are thankful to know that they will accommodate us , as Rome is full to overflowing now , all the world going up thither for Easter . 
When I told my maid that we were going to Rome to-morrow , she clasped her hands in ecstasy , exclaiming , " Bella Roma ! 
Bella Roma ! " 
These Italians have a natural instinct for beauty and a genuine pride in the wonders of their own country , both of which help them to endure the poverty and hardness of their lives , just as some people of your acquaintance and mine are supported through many trials by the uplifting sense of having been born in the purple . 
GENOA , February 20th . 
I awoke to hear the rain beating against my window and Angela 's merry voice at my side , saying , " Such an experience ! 
Zelphine rang our bell , thinking that she would have a fire or smoke or something to take off the deadly chill from our room . 
In a minute there came a knock at the door , and instead of the chambermaid there stood a grand gentleman in a blue coat and brass buttons , with a breakfast-tray - the proprietor or head waiter , I should say . 
We had n't the courage to say a word about fire to this dignified person . 
Indeed , he gave us no time to say anything , as he set the tray on a table beside the bed , and vanished with ' Madame est servie . ' 
Of course Z. is the madame ; I do n't count , being jeune fille . 
Such manners Z. says she has seldom seen in a ballroom at home . 
So now , Margaret , the breakfast is there and must be eaten . 
Do order yours , and let us breakfast together . " " 
A kimono déjeuner à trois , " I said , laughing over Angela 's ignorance of Continental ways , to which I had become quite accustomed during my art winter in Paris with Katharine Clarke . " 
A second ring may fetch the maid and fire , " said Angela , pressing the button . 
This , however , only served to bring the blue-coated waiter , with another tray of coffee and rolls . 
It was some time before we were able to get the maid , who , in turn , sent for the facchino who attends to the fires , and he , assisted by another facchino , finally succeeded in fanning into a blaze the infinitesimal quantity of wood used here for a fire . 
This " house that Jack built " distribution of labor is rather puzzling to the uninitiated . 
We are wondering how we shall ever compass the problem of fees , so many people are serving us . " 
I do n't wonder that Eugene Field sang with longing of the ' land of stoves and sunshine , ' " said Zelphine , as she held her hands over the feeble flame , " if he ever stayed in Genoa in February . " 
This is the nearest approach to a complaint that Zelphine has uttered since we left New York . 
She accepts everything that comes to us , good , bad , or indifferent , as a part of the game . 
We breakfasted heartily , calling for more rolls and boiled eggs , to the evident but entirely well-bred astonishment of the presiding genius , who was not accustomed to such early morning appetites . 
The rain continued to pour in torrents ; and here let me confess , with more or less contrition , that we were all three most desperately homesick . 
Whether it was that we missed our pleasant fellow-travellers who were steaming off for Nice to-day , or because of the persistent rain , we , one after another , fell a prey to the depressing malady . 
Angela , first of all , with eyes full of tears , wondered many times , in language more or less strenuous , why she had ever left her happy home for these inhospitable shores ; and I - well , it matters little what I said . 
Zelphine surprised me weeping over my travelling-hat , which , although it did present a rather dilapidated appearance after yesterday 's rain , failed to afford sufficient cause for my tears . 
She , the heroic one , who had never told her woe , in attempting to console me broke down herself , and we wept in each other 's arms , which had the good result of bringing Angela to our side and making her laugh heartily . 
Finally , in desperation , I proposed that we should order a cab and drive over to the Hôtel de Londres and try to find some of our steamer friends who expected to stay here a few days en route for Florence . 
We were cordially welcomed by Bertha Linn and Mrs. Robins , who received us in their rooms , one of which was comfortably heated by a porcelain stove . 
Despite their more favorable surroundings , we soon discovered that our two countrywomen were as down-hearted as ourselves . 
Bertha , seated upon a trunk , looking about as cheerful as Miss Betsey Trotwood when she came up to London in pursuit of her scattered fortune , expressed herself to the effect that foreign travel might be of advantage educationally and enlarging to the mind , but for her part she preferred her own country , and would gladly take the next steamer back to New York . 
Angela heartily agreed with Bertha , while Zelphine begged her to remember the enchanting days we had spent in Madeira and Granada , and that even more delightful experiences lay before us , assuring them that Italy is not a proverbially rainy country , et cetera ; in the midst of which profitable conversation Mrs. Robins suggested that we should take cabs and drive to the Campo Santo , by way of a diversion . " 
We certainly are in a proper frame of mind for a visit to a cemetery , " said Angela , laughing a cheerless laugh , with a minor chord in it suggestive of tears near the surface . 
No place could be more admirably adapted for a rainy day excursion than the Campo Santo of Genoa , as that vast cemetery is nearly all under cover . 
Our first impression of the long galleries with their monuments and low reliefs , many of them decorated with photographs of the dead and overhung with the tasteless wreaths of tin flowers dear to the Continental mourner , was of something hopelessly inartistic and artificial . 
Among the many shockingly realistic and inappropriate monuments we found a few simple and beautiful statues and low reliefs . 
You remember how many of the monuments in Westminster Abbey are in bad taste and overweighted with carved ornaments ; the majority of these are not less artistic , but one has a right to expect more beauty and grace in Italy than in England , and then the grand old abbey lends a certain dignity to everything within its walls . 
The Campo Santo looks more like a picture-gallery than a necropolis ; but chacun à son goût . 
This is evidently the goût of the Genoese , and the name of their cemetery is so beautiful that I , for one , am inclined to overlook lack of taste in other matters . 
The tomb of the patriot Giuseppe Mazzini is in this Campo Santo , above the rotunda and over against the steep hillside . 
It did not impress us particularly ; but we found ourselves turning again and again to the figure of an old woman in a fine brocade gown , with a ring of bread , which here they call pain de la couronne , over her arm , and what seemed to be strings of large pearls depending from her waist . " 
It is evidently the statue of some great lady who sold her pearls to raise money to feed the poor , " said Zelphine . " 
Here are the pearls , and she carries the bread on her arm just as the peasants do in Spain and in all these southern countries . 
I wish we could find the story somewhere and the lady 's name . 
This statue may have been erected by a grateful people in recognition of her generous aid . " " 
She certainly has the face and bearing of a peasant , rather than of a grand lady , " said Bertha . 
Just then we heard a low , infectious laugh behind us , and turned to find General W. , one of our ship 's company , who was evidently much amused by our discussion , and made haste to tear Zelphine 's romance into shreds by explaining that her Lady Bountiful was a peasant woman who made quite a sum of money by selling bread and nuts on the streets of Genoa . 
Having an ambition to rest with the rich and great in the Campo Santo , under a fine monument , she bought the right to be buried here for three thousand francs , and had the pleasure of ordering her own monument , for which she paid six thousand francs . 
Nine thousand francs , in all , for glory - quite a fortune for a peasant ! " 
The pearls are only nuts , after all ! " 
exclaimed Zelphine , " and ---- " " The cake is dough , " said Bertha , laughing ; " but it is all very interesting as a study in human nature . 
I do n't doubt the poor woman found great satisfaction in looking at this fine figure of herself . " " 
She did not have even that satisfaction , " replied General W. , " for she died soon after she had ordered it , in a street brawl or something of the sort . 
Sic transit gloria mundi . " " 
How you do break down our images and bowl over our idols ! " 
exclaimed Angela . 
We had dismissed our cabs on entering the Campo Santo , and , as the rain had ceased for the time , we returned by the electric tram of the Via di Circonvallazione a Mare , which runs close to the sea , and which , as Angela says , besides circumambulating the city , is a clever way of circumventing the cabman . 
Our homesickness had disappeared amid the shades of the departed , and , a merry party , we made our way to the Concordia , that most delightful garden-café . 
Here we lunched upon risotto ( rice made yellow with saffron ) , spaghetti , and other Italian dishes , with an accompaniment of bread in small sticks , crisp and brown . 
CHAPTER IV . 
FROM CONSTANTINOPLE TO FLORENCE . 
The morning I went to hear High Mass in the Chapel del Tesoro , it presented an animated and magnificent spectacle . 
The windows were darkened by crimson blinds , to keep the strong sunlight out , and the chapel was lighted up by numberless candles , the light of which was reflected by the silver ornaments that deck the whole chapel . 
The way up to the altar was lined with soldiers , I suppose to prevent disturbances in the eager crowd that longed to kiss the liquefied blood . 
The people walked up in good order to the altar , but on the sides down which they returned , there was a good deal of squeezing and pushing . 
The priest that held the little glass case , containing the two phials in his hand , and who showed them to the congregation , shook the liquefied blood about , and thrust the case into the people ’s faces with so rudely irreverent a manner , that I , who am no believer in the miracle , felt shocked ; what impression it made upon the other people I can not tell . 
They looked however quite contented and pleased . 
They were mostly priests and nuns , and persons of the lower orders , but I observed also some who appeared to belong to the upper classes . 
While the crowd kissed the blood of the Saint the choir sang a most beautiful mass , and the rich voices with which bountiful Nature has endowed so many of her children under the blue sky of Naples , filled the chapel with harmony , and made the chords of my heart vibrate in unison . 
There was a bass voice among them that reminded me of Lablache . 
On the evening of the same day I had witnessed the miracle of the liquefaction in the Chapel del Tesoro , the son of the famous conjuror Bosco repeated the trick before the boxes crowded with elegant ladies at the Theatre St. Carlo , but I did not go to see it . 
Ever since I am out of my teens , I no longer care for conjuring tricks ; besides I had seen it done so well in the morning . 
I was however told that the trick in the evening succeeded quite as well , and was repeated several times before a smiling and applauding audience . 
I visited most of the other principal churches of Naples . 
The Church of St. Severo is full of fine modern statues . 
One representing a man who is trying to free himself from the meshes of a net in which he is entangled , and which is called “ the snares of the world , ” is very clever . 
Another one called “ Modesty ” is graceful , but as a representation of modesty , might have a somewhat thicker veil . 
At the Museo Borbonico , now called “ Reale , ” I admired some of the finest Greek marbles I have ever seen . 
The grand Torro Farnese , the wonderful Hercules , of the same famous collection , a Flora , that looks something between a Juno and a Venus , stately and graceful at the same time , the most charming representation of virgin youth I have ever seen . 
There is a whole room full of Venuses , of which one is certainly very beautiful , although apparently too conscious of her charms to please me very much . 
“ I must go up Mount Vesuvius before we leave Naples , ” I said to my husband , and he , not less desirous than myself to visit a volcano , set out with me early the next morning , for the ascent of the mountain . 
I know it is considered a beautiful sight to see the sun rise from the top of Vesuvius , but as it rises in the middle of May at a most unreasonably early hour , we despaired of getting to the top before the sun , so we let the god travel alone for several hours , and did not leave our hotel in the Chiatamone till a little after six o’clock . 
An hour ’s quick drive brought us to Resina . 
Our way to the latter led us through the village of St. Giovanni , where one sees nothing but macaroni and pigs . 
Most of the houses are small macaroni manufactories , and the fresh macaroni are on long sticks , hung out into the street to dry . 
Most of the manufacturers keep a pig , which is tied to some post in the street , not far from the door of the house , or if a very tame , good little pig , runs about free . 
After St. Giovanni , we passed through Portici , the home of Masaniello and his poor sister Fenella . 
Here there are delightful villas , with gardens sloping down to the bay , and close to it lies Resina , where the ascent of the mountain on horseback begins . 
There used to be a fine carriage road as far as St. Salvator , which is about an hour ’s ride up the mountain , but the lava streams of the great eruption of 1859 , have entirely destroyed it . 
We had not been more than ten minutes on our horses , when we came to these formidable traces of the last great eruption of the volcano . 
In broad thick masses the lava had flowed down the sides of the mountain into the blooming orchards and fruitful vineyards , to which the dark , dead rivers of stone presented a striking contrast . 
These lava streams have a strange and diverse appearance . 
Sometimes the surface is roughly even and resembles immense masses of curiously twisted burnt trunks , and branches of trees . 
At other places it is more like a roughly ploughed field that by a sharp frost has become still more broken up than by the plough . 
Between the lava are large beds of ashes and cinders . 
The ride to the foot of the cone , which lasted about an hour and a half , presented no difficulty , for the road rises very gradually and is broad , and lava presents a rough surface on which the horses ’ feet do not slip . 
The cone must be climbed on foot , and is a very tiring piece of work even with the assistance of two guides , the one to pull you up with the help of a band fastened round his waist , the other pushing you up by placing one of his hands against your back . 
As climbing does not easily tire me I wanted to walk up , to which my husband however objected ; so I had to sit down in a chair in which the guides carried me up . 
One guide in front held the two poles which were fastened to the chair in his hands , two men behind carried each one on his shoulder , and thus kept the chair in a horizontal position . 
It must be very hard work indeed to carry any body for an hour up so steep an ascent ; for my husband , although he was assisted in the already described manner by two guides , found it very tiring indeed . 
The men did it however cheerfully , and with less appearance of fatigue than I had expected . 
When we had reached the top , and my husband and the men had rested awhile , we walked to the brink of the crater , and now I saw , with my own eyes , the strange and grand spectacle to the description of which I remember to have listened with almost incredulous wonder when a little school girl , and which to see I had longed for ever since we had passed Mount Etna and Stromboli . 
The volcano was in a very fair state of activity . 
Thick volumes of smoke issued from it , and about every two minutes there was a loud report as of thunder or cannon , and then flames appeared , and ashes and stones were ejected flying high up into the air , and falling down with a rattling noise . 
It must not however be thought that we stood close to the terrible opening out of which rose the flames and smoke . 
Within the large crater from the brink of which we witnessed the spectacle , rises , what looks a Vesuvius on a smaller scale , and on the top of this , which is however below the level of the place where we stood , is the real crater . 
It is very fascinating to watch the eruptions , and we found it difficult to turn our backs upon it , and look a little at the scene around us in the beautiful world below . 
The top of Vesuvius looks terribly dreary ; the dread abode of horror and destruction . 
Nothing but the dark lava stones and ashes all around . 
There is of course no trace of animal or vegetable life visible anywhere . 
The sad monotony is however a little relieved by the different colours of the lava and the stones ; especially by the bright yellow of the sulphur one sees in large quantities . 
This hideous image of death and destruction rises abruptly out of Elysian plains and vallies ; its foot is washed by the azure sea dotted with emerald islands , and above smiles a limpid sky . 
The view is very extensive , because Vesuvius is a mountain of considerable altitude ; yet as it rises so abruptly out of the plain and sea , the view has the distinctness of no great distance , which adds much to its charm . 
It is lovely on all sides ; but from the point that overlooks Naples , the Bay and its lovely shores , the Mediterranean , and the islands of Capri , Ischia and Procida , it is deservedly considered one of the most lovely in the world . 
In going up the volcano the guides had chosen a stony , rough stream of lava , which affords a safe footing ; in going down , on the contrary , they chose a bed of fine cinders and ashes , and ran or slid rapidly down . 
What it had taken us an hour to ascend , my husband descended in six minutes , and I , chair and all , took only about double that time . 
It is a very dusty affair , the black ashes whirl up under the feet of the men , and envelope one completely . 
Never was a tepid bath more refreshing than the one I enjoyed in the evening after I had come home from my visit to Vesuvius . 
The guides had pointed out to us the lava streams of the different eruptions , and the immense stones and pieces of rock which were ejected by the volcano in 1822 . 
In looking at these formidable pieces of rock , of which some were at a great distance from the crater , one gets an idea of the power that is working within it , and the fate of Herculaneum and Pompeii becomes intelligible . 
The latter place we had visited the day before . 
All I felt there is expressed in those few words : “ Sic transit gloria mundi . ” 
But never before had I realized so fully what the instability of all earthly greatness means . 
In this city of the dead I felt far , far removed from the present , and my mind for a moment seemed to realize what the future really means . 
A time , when the lovely city I had just left would have disappeared from the face of the earth , and its old site be a matter of doubt and uncertainty , when the language of Dante would survive perhaps in his book only , when the very features of sea and mountain around me might be changed ; for had not eighteen hundred years ago , the waves of the gulf washed the walls of Pompeii that now lies far inland , and another Vesuvius burned than the one we ascended ? 
And I saw with my mind ’s eye the proud city across the sea , which I had left a few months before , as Macaulay , thinking of a time to come , describes it , a heap of ruins ; and a traveller in a strange dress , speaking a language which is not yet formed , sitting on a broken arch of London Bridge , meditating like me at that moment on the truth of the words , “ Sic transit gloria mundi . ” 
We did not , as Murray recommends , enter Pompeii by the Strada dei Sepolcri , but through the Porta del Mare , and I liked it better , as the Strada de Sepolcri forms the fittest finale of the town . 
I have heard of people who have been disappointed in Pompeii , others have said the same of the Acropolis . 
I can not understand such people . 
They must be more dead than the very stones there , for they spoke to me , and what they said moved me deeply . 
When I first entered the city of the dead , I felt strange and bewildered like in a dream . 
Surely “ reality is stranger than fiction . ” 
What can be more strange than that the sun should shine again into the streets , and light up the painted walls and mosaic pavement of Pompeii . 
And yet so it is . 
That very old Pompeii , that lay for nearly eighteen centuries buried , is risen again . 
We walk through its streets , and tread the very stones worn out by the footsteps of Roman citizens , and by the wheels of their chariots . 
We see their houses , their temples , their judgment halls , their baths and theatres , their gardens and court-yards , in which however the little fountain is silenced for ever . 
In walking into their houses we seem to become strangely familiar with their former inhabitants ; we see everywhere traces of their being , of their virtues and vices , of their greatness and their folly . 
I daresay by night the spirits of the departed haunt the silent town ; but it was by broad cheerful daylight that I visited it , and therefore it seemed inhabited only by pretty little lizards , which I saw flitting about on every wall , and between the delicate ferns that grow in the silent streets of Pompeii . 
ASSISI , Saturday Evening , May 1st . 
As we first beheld Assisi from the railroad station at sunset , the delicate mauve pink of her towers and walls glowed with a more rosy hue and it seemed as if the old town for a brief moment must have worn something of the grace of her long-vanished youth . 
On one side of the station is the little village of the plain , Santa Maria degli Angeli , with the church from which it takes its name , so christened by St. Francis in memory of the angelic visions here granted him . 
On the other side of the road , across a sweep of green meadows , is the town , built upon terraces half-way up the hill , Mount Subasio towering beyond it to a height of over three thousand feet above the sea-level . 
The crowning glory of Assisi is the great basilica of San Francesco , with its remarkable substructure - a vast colonnaded monastery standing guard over the happy valley beneath . 
Our approach was by winding roads bordered by hedges , with fields beyond green as England and bright as Italy alone , all abloom to-day with poppies and buttercups . 
Up and up the shining way climbed the shabby vettura with its lean horse , until we seemed to be getting near the blue of the sky , so close does the arch of heaven lean to these hill towns of Italy . 
We all felt that we had left the world of to-day far behind us when we drove through the ancient Porta San Francesco , so entirely does Assisi belong to the past . 
Here where everything is ancient one ceases to make comparisons , and it seemed no more remarkable to find a Temple of Minerva standing beside twelfth-century buildings , than that we three twentieth-century Americans should be driving about these old streets , hearing the vetturino talk about St. Francis as if he had lived but yesterday . 
You really must not expect an ordinary letter of to-day from this place , where we are so absolutely dominated by the twelfth century . 
Zelphine , who is in a state of rapture and quite lifted above the ordinary affairs of life , is probably writing a poem at this moment , having been incited thereto by the history of Assisi 's celebrated poet , Propertius , which she has just read to us from a charming little book which she found in Perugia . 
The story runs thus : Propertius , who was a contemporary of Virgil and Horace , relinquished the congenial atmosphere of Rome and the friendly companionship of the author of the " Metamorphoses " for the love of his Umbrian birthplace , where the Muse had first visited him . 
Recognized in his own day as the leader of a new school of poetry , Propertius appreciated his own powers sufficiently to write of himself in connection with his native town : " Ancient Umbria gave thee birth , from a noted household . 
Do I mistake , or do I touch rightly the region of your home , where misty Mevania stands among the dews of the hill-girt plain , and the waters of the Umbrian lake grow warm the summer through , and where on the summit of mounting Asis rise the walls to which genius has added glory ? " 
His own genius ! 
And yet , to prove to us that he was not wanting in modesty , Propertius has placed this charming compliment in the mouth of a soothsayer . 
If this is all familiar to you , O most learned , it is so fresh to me that you must allow me to repeat it , because it reveals once more the truth of the Scriptures - that a prophet is not without honor save in his own country . 
Propertius would not have been forced to sing his own praises if his contemporaries had sung them in the right key . 
The little inn at which we are stopping , with its bare , stone floors and whitewashed walls , is quite primitive enough to have suited St. Francis and his brothers . 
We are told that there is another and larger hotel , which is more modern in its appointments . " 
The idea of caring for a modern hotel or anything modern in Assisi ! " 
exclaimed Zelphine , walking with me toward the window of one of the rooms offered us . 
A single glance out of that window decided us to stay . 
The Albergo Giotto is built on a cliff , and literally overhangs the valley . 
From our windows we look out upon green slopes billowing beneath us until they break away into the long reaches of the plain , where the dome of St. Mary of the Angels stands out against the sky . 
RIVIERA , February 26th . 
The days pass all too quickly in this charming place . 
My mornings are generally spent in walking - sometimes on the Promenade du Midi , which lies near the sea , a beautiful , palm-bordered terrace above the beach - or in wandering through the old quarter of San Remo , with Roger and Phœbe by my side . 
Here are narrow , precipitous streets like those of Genoa , in strong contrast with the gay walk by the sea , which has all the characteristics of a foreign watering-place . 
The vive la bagatelle existence of the Promenade du Midi is not without its charm once in a while , but in the winding streets of the old town is the typical life of San Remo . 
We watch the vendors of fruit , vegetables , nuts , and herbs displaying their simple wares upon the sidewalk , or stroll down by the bank where the washing is done , picturesquely , if somewhat laboriously , in the open . 
The lavandaie are , most of them , vigorous young creatures , and as they beat the clothes against the stones or rinse them in the clear , running water , their merry chatter and laughter suggest social joys even beyond those of our voluble Bridgets at home . 
Your mother 's favorite saw about the back being fitted to the burden often recurs to me here . 
If these peasants are poor , their wants are few , they live in a divine climate , the whole of the out-of-doors is theirs , and , above all , they have dispositions and digestions that may well cause them to be envied of princes . 
Dr. A. , Genevra 's physician , tells me that the peasants here are usually healthy and the children as robust as they are handsome . 
This Italian gentleman is one of the interesting characters of San Remo . 
I always feel like calling him Doctor Antonio , for although Dr. A. has travelled extensively , and speaks English perfectly , he is quite Italian in appearance and manner , and so loyally devoted to his Italy that I am quite sure he would have sacrificed life and fortune to her cause had he lived in the stirring times that developed Ruffini 's heroic Doctor Antonio . 
On Sunday afternoon Roger and Phœbe drove me up to the little sanctuary of the Madonna della Guardia . 
Our road crossed that leading to Bussana Vecchia , which picturesque ruin attracts me by its mystery and its remoteness from the life of to-day . 
If you were here you would certainly explore the remains of this old town , and perhaps you would take me with you through its silent streets . 
Just now fate seems to be against my seeing it . 
On Saturday , when we were all ready to set forth , the rain fell in torrents , and on Sunday there was no time to stop on our way to Capo Verde , so Bussana Vecchia seems destined to be my " Carcassonne . " 
The little sanctuary of the Madonna della Guardia is built , like the home of the wise man of the Scriptures , upon a rock , crowning the promontory of Capo Verde . 
From the heights there is a fine panorama , as they say here , of sea and shore ; Taggia and Poggio were at our feet as we stood on the shelving rock , which overhangs a sheer declivity of many feet . 
In the church there is a collection of curious pictures , votive offerings , representing men and women in the midst of deadly peril by field and flood : fishermen in boats tossing upon stormy seas , and carriage-loads of pleasure-seekers pitching down precipices or dashing along the road at the mercy of steeds as wild as that of Mazeppa . 
All of these good people , as appears from the expressions of gratitude recorded in the several paintings , were saved from sudden and horrible death by the powerful intervention of the gentle Mother of Sorrows and Mercies . 
I am finishing this letter while Genevra sings to the children their good-night songs and tucks them into their beds . 
To-morrow will be a full day , with some commissions to be attended to at the shops , which are tempting here , two or three visits , and an afternoon tea with some charming Scotch ladies at the Hôtel de Londres . 
The day following I leave here for Nice , having decided to meet Zelphine and Angela there instead of at Genoa as I had intended . 
This change of plan is made in order that we may take the famous drive from Nice to Genoa , which Dr. A. assures me is not as dangerous as it appears , and in beauty more nearly approaches the description of Paradise than anything else to be seen upon earthly shores . 
If we make the trip in an automobile , which we shall probably do , we shall have a couple of hours to spend here with Genevra en route for Genoa , which anticipation helps to console her for her disappointment in losing two days of my visit . 
She will then be able to judge for herself whether Angela is as pretty as I have described her and whether Zelphine is as charming with white hair as with brown , questions that may seem of little moment to the masculine mind , but are deeply interesting to Genevra . 
She will be calling me soon to join her at what Macaulay calls " the curling hour , " which we count the best in the twenty-four . 
Lucie heaps up the olive-wood on the hearth until it blazes brightly , and places a tray with chocolate before us . 
Thus cheered and sustained we gossip into " the wee , sma ' hours . " 
Genevra asks so many questions about her old friends that we should have to talk until the cocks crow if I were to answer them all . 
By the way , do your ears ever burn these nights about twelve o ' the clock ? 
She often talks of you , asks if you have grown more sedate with added years and dignities , whether you have lost your habit of jesting , and speaks of a certain merry twinkle in the corner of your eye which used to betray you when mischief was brewing - on the whole Genevra cherishes a very cousinly affection for your lordship . 
There ! 
she is calling me , so " Good-night ! 
- if the longitude please , - For , maybe , while wasting my taper , Your sun 's climbing over the trees . " Viareggio ( February ) 
Viareggio , dead at this season , is a rowdy place in summer ; not rowdy , however , after the fashion of Margate . 
There is a suggestive difference between the two . 
The upper classes in both towns are of course irreproachable in externals - it is their uniformity of behaviour throughout the world which makes them so uninteresting from a spectacular point of view . 
A place does not receive its tone from them ( save possibly Bournemouth ) but from their inferiors ; and here , in this matter of public decorum , the comparison is to the credit of Italy . 
It is beside the point to say that the one lies relatively remote , while the other is convenient for cheap trips from a capital . 
Set Viareggio down at the very gate of Rome and fill it with the scum of Trastevere : the difference would still be there . 
It might be more noisy than Margate . 
It would certainly be less blatant . 
As for myself , I hate Viareggio at all seasons , and nothing would have brought me here but the prospect of visiting the neighbouring Carrara mines with Attilio to whom I have written , enclosing a postcard for reply . 
For this is a modern town built on a plain of mud and sand , a town of heartrending monotony , the least picturesque of all cities in the peninsula , the least Italian . 
It has not even a central piazza ! 
You may conjure up visions of Holland and detect something of an old-world aroma , if you stroll about the canal and harbour where sails are now flapping furiously in the north wind ; you may look up to the snow-covered peaks and imagine yourself in Switzerland , and then thank God you are not there ; of Italy I perceive little or nothing . 
The people are birds of prey ; a shallow and rapacious brood who fleece visitors during those summer weeks and live on the proceeds for the rest of the year . 
There is no commerce to liven them up and make them smilingly polite ; no historical tradition to give them self-respect ; no agriculture worth mentioning ( the soil is too poor ) - in other words , no peasantry to replenish the gaps in city life and infuse an element of decency and depth . 
An inordinate amount of singing and whistling goes on all day long . 
Is it not a sign of empty-headedness ? 
I would like the opinion of schoolmasters on this point , whether , among the children committed to their charge , the habitual whistlers be not the dullest of wit . 
And so five days have passed . 
A pension proving uninhabitable , and most of the better-class hotels being closed for the winter , I threw myself upon the mercy of an octroi official who stood guarding a forlorn gate somewhere in the wilderness . 
He has sent me to a villa bearing the name of a certain lady and situated in a street called after a certain politician . 
He has done well . 
A kindlier dame than my hostess could nowhere be found . 
She hails from the province of the Marche and has no high opinion of this town , where she only lives on account of her husband , a retired something-or-other who owns the house . 
Although convulsed with grief , both of them , at the moment of my arrival - a favourite kitten had just been run over - they at once set about making me comfortable in a room with exposure due south . 
The flooring is of cement : the usual Viareggio custom . 
Bricks are cold , stone is cold , tiles are cold ; but cement ! 
It freezes your marrow through double carpets . 
For meals I go to the " Assassino " or the Vittoria hotel ; the fare is better at the first , the company at the other ... . 
The large dining-room at the " Vittoria " is not in use just now . 
We take our meals in two smaller rooms adjoining each other , one of which leads into the kitchen where privileged guests may talk secrets with the cook and poke their noses into saucepans . 
At a table by herself sits the little signorina who controls the establishment , wide awake , pale of complexion , slightly hump-backed , close-fisted as the devil though sufficiently vulnerable to a bluff masculine protest . 
Our waiter is noteworthy in his line . 
He is that exceptional being , an Italian snob ; he can talk of nothing but dukes and princes , Bourbons by choice , because he once served at a banquet given by some tuppenny Parma royalties round the corner . 
The food would be endurable , save for those vile war-time maccheroni . 
The wine is of doubtful origin . 
Doubtful , at least , to the uninitiated who smacks his lips and wonders vaguely where he has tasted the stuff before . 
The concoction has so many flavours - a veritable Proteus ! 
I know it well , though its father and mother would be hard to identify . 
It was born on the banks of the Tiber and goes by the name of ripa : ask any Roman . 
Certain cheap and heady products of the south - Sicily , Sardinia , Naples , Apulia , Ischia - have contributed their share to its composition ; Tiber-water is the one and constant ingredient . 
This ripa is exported by the ton to wine-less centres like Genoa and there drunk under any name you please . 
A few butts have doubtless been dropped overboard at Viareggio for the poisoning of its ten thousand summer visitors . 
Quite a jolly crowd of folk assembles here every evening . 
There is , of course , the ubiquitous retired major ; also some amusing gentlemen who run up and down between this place and Lucca on mysterious errands connected , I fancy , with oil ; as well as a dissipated young marquis sent hither from Rimini by the ridiculously old-fashioned father to expiate his sins - his gambling debts , his multifarious and costly love-adventures , and the manslaughter of a carpenter whom he ran over in his car . 
My favourite is a fat creature with a glorious fleshy face , the face of some Neronian parvenu - a memorable face , full of the brutal prosperity of Trimalchio 's Banquet . 
He told me , yesterday , a long story about a local saint in one of their villages - a saint of yesterday who , curing diseases and performing various other miracles , began to think himself , as their manner is , God Almighty , or something to that effect . 
The police shot him as a revolutionary , because he had gathered a few adherents . " 
Rather an extreme measure , " I suggested . " 
It is . 
Not that I love the saints . 
But I love the police still less . " " 
Like every good Italian . " " 
Like every good Italian .... " News from Attilio . 
He can not come . 
Both mother and sister are ill . 
He delayed writing in the hopes of their getting better ; he wanted to join me , but they are always " auguale " - the same ; in short , he must stay at home , as appears from the following plaintive and rather puzzling postcard , the address of which I had providentially written myself : Caro G. N. Dorcola ho ricevuto la sua cara lettera e son cozi contento da sentire le sue notizzie io non posso venire perche mia madre e amalata e mia sorella Enrica era tardato ascirvere perche mi credevo che tesano mellio ma invece sono sempre auguale perche volevo venire ci mando dici mille baci e una setta dimano addio al Signior D. Dor . 
But for the fact that , counting on a fortnight 's trip to Carrara , I have asked for certain printed matter to be forwarded here from England , I would jump into the next train for anywhere . 
Running along the sea on either side of Viareggio is a noble forest of stone pines where the wind is scarce felt , though you may hear it sighing overhead among the crowns . 
This is the place for a promenade at all hours of the day . 
Children climb the trunks to fetch down a few remaining cones or break off dried branches as fuel . 
A sportsman told me that several of them lose their lives every year at this adventure . 
What was he doing here , with a gun ? 
Waiting for a hare , he said . 
They always wait for hares . 
There are none ! 
Then a poor thin woman , dressed in black and gathering the prickly stalks of gorse for firewood , began to converse with me , reasonably enough at first . 
All of a sudden her language changed into a burning torrent of insanity , with wild gesticulations . 
She was the Queen of the country , she avowed , the rightful Queen , and they had robbed her of all her children , every one of them , and all her jewels . 
I agreed - what else could one do ? 
Being in the combustible stage , she went over the argument again and again , her eyes fiercely flashing . 
Nothing could stop the flow of her words . 
I was right glad when another woman came to my rescue and pushed her along , as you would a calf , saying : " You go home now , it 's getting dark , run along ! 
- yes , yes ! 
you 're the Queen right enough - she was in the asylum , Sir , for three months and then they let her out , the fools - of course you are , everybody knows that ! 
But you really must n't annoy this gentleman any more - her husband and son were both killed in the war , that 's what started it - we 'll fetch them tomorrow at the palace , all those things , and the children , only do n't talk so much - they thought she was cured , but just hark at her ! 
- va bene , it 's all yours , only get along - she 'll be back there in a day or two , wo n't she ? 
- really , you are chattering much too much , for a Queen ; va bene , va bene , va bene - " A sad little incident , under the pines ... . 
A fortnight has elapsed . 
I refuse to budge from Viareggio , having discovered the village of Corsanico on the heights yonder and , in that village , a family altogether to my liking . 
How one stumbles upon delightful folks ! 
Set me down in furthest Cathay and I will undertake to find , soon afterwards , some person with whom I am quite prepared to spend the remaining years of life . 
The driving-road to Corsanico is a never-ending affair . 
Deep in mire , it meanders perversely about the plain ; meanders more than ever , but of necessity , once the foot of the hills is reached . 
I soon gave it up in favour of the steam-tram to Cammaiore which deposits you at a station whose name I forget , whence you may ascend to Corsanico through a village called , I think , Momio . 
That route , also , was promptly abandoned when the path along the canal was revealed to me . 
This waterway runs in an almost straight line from Viareggio to the base of that particular hill on whose summit lies my village . 
It is a monotonous walk at this season ; the rich marsh vegetation slumbers in the ooze underground , waiting for a breath of summer . 
At last you cross that big road and strike the limestone rock . 
Here is no intermediate region , no undulating ground , between the upland and the plain . 
They converge abruptly upon each other , as might have been expected , seeing that these hills used to be the old sea-board and this green level , in olden days , the Mediterranean . 
Three different tracks , leading steeply upward through olives and pines and chestnuts from where the canal ends , will bring you to Corsanico . 
I know them all . 
I could find my way in darkest midnight . 
Days have passed ; days of delight . 
I climb up in the morning and descend at nightfall , my mind well stored with recollections of pleasant talk and smiling faces . 
A large place , this Corsanico , straggling about the hill-top with scattered farms and gardens ; to reach the tobacconist - near whose house , by the way , you obtain an unexpected glimpse into the valley of Cammaiore - is something of an excursion . 
As a rule we repose , after luncheon , on a certain wooded knoll . 
We are high up ; seven or eight hundred feet above the canal . 
The blue Tyrrhenian is dotted with steamers and sailing boats , and yonder lies Viareggio in its belt of forest ; far away , to the left , you discern the tower of Pisa . 
A placid lake between the two , wood-engirdled , is now famous as being the spot selected by the great Maestro Puccini to spend a summer month in much-advertised seclusion . 
I am learning the name of every locality in the plain , of every peak among the mountains at our back . " 
And that little ridge of stone , " says my companion , " - do you see it , jutting into the fields down there ? 
It has a queer name . 
We call it La Sirena . " 
La Sirena ... . 
It is good to live in a land where such memories cling to old rocks . 
By what a chance has the name survived to haunt this inland crag , defying geological changes , outlasting the generations of men , their creeds and tongues and races ! 
How it takes one back - back into hoary antiquity , into another landscape altogether ! 
One thinks of those Greek mariners coasting past this promontory , and pouring libations to the Siren into an ocean on whose untrampled floor the countryman now sows his rice and turnips . 
Paganisme immortel , es-tu mort ? 
On le dit . 
Mais Pan , tout bas , s ' en moque , et la Sirène en rit . 
They are still here , both sea and Siren ; they have only agreed to separate for a while . 
The ocean shines out yonder in all its luminous splendour of old . 
And the Siren , too , can be found by those to whom the gods are kind . 
My Siren dwells at Corsanico . 
NAPLES , March 6th . 
We have been wondering , ever since we came here , where the beauty and fashion of Naples are to be found , having seen on the streets only tradespeople and beggars . 
We put the question to our friend the concierge at the Hotel B . 
At five o'clock in the afternoon , he told us , the beau monde could be seen taking an airing on the Chiaia , never earlier . 
It seems that Neapolitans of quality do not drive while the sun is shining . 
You remember that old Italian proverb about only dogs and Englishmen liking the sun ? 
To this I would add the wise peasants , with whom its genial warmth takes the place of food , fire , and proper clothing . 
Five o'clock on a March afternoon is a rather chilly and uncomfortable hour for a drive ; but we should have to go then or give up all idea of a fashionable promenade en voiture with the élite of Naples . 
This afternoon was the time arranged for our drive . 
A carrozza , a two-horse carriage , was to meet us at a favorite coral shop on the Chiaia , whose exquisite wares draw Angela daily with a glittering eye . 
Having arranged with Zelphine about this rendezvous , I left her hanging over some Pompeian statuettes in a shop on the Toledo , copies , of course , but very good ones , quite too tempting to be safely dallied with , and made my way to Thomas Cook 's office and to several glove shops . 
When my commissions were finished , I had more than an hour on my hands , so I lingered for some time before the tall monument in the Square of the Martyrs , a memorial to the patriots who perished during several Neapolitan revolutions . 
This monument has much of the simplicity and strength of the Nelson memorial on Trafalgar Square , having like it four colossal bronze lions at the base . 
The noble shaft is surmounted by one of Caggiani 's graceful figures , a Victory delicately poised as if on tiptoe for a flight . 
After gazing long at the beautiful monument , I strolled down the Strada Chiaia to the esplanade with the statues and fountains , a charming place to walk on a cool afternoon . 
You know my fancy for wandering alone through strange streets and byways . 
On and on I sauntered , thinking that I might have time to walk as far as the Aquarium before keeping my tryst at the coral shop , and not fully realizing how deserted the place was until I heard a penetrating voice quite close to me speaking rapid and almost unintelligible French , accompanied by the cracking of a whip . " 
A cabman - I 'll pay no attention to him , " I said to myself ; " he 'll be discouraged after a while and leave me . " 
I soon found that I had reckoned without my host : that vociferous , whip-cracking Jehu followed me , dogged my steps , offered me his cab at absurdly low rates , and finally cornered me in a recess of one of the large public buildings . 
I looked around ; there was not a person in sight to help me , only a few beggars on the steps , who would naturally make common cause with the cabman . 
You will laugh at me , I am sure , but so terrified was I by the creature 's language and gestures and whip-cracking that I abjectly stepped into his cab , telling him to drive me for an hour and set me down at the well-known coral shop on the Chiaia at five o'clock , showing him the time on my watch-face . 
Was I not just a bit like the woman who married a persistent suitor in order to get rid of him ? 
Her troubles probably began then and there ; mine certainly did . 
My cocher , with an irritating expression of triumph on his face , set forth upon a tour of sight-seeing which threatened to be of long duration . 
We passed from street to street , from building to building , until to my dismay I found that he was driving toward the upper town . 
I protested , knowing that there would not be time to get back to the Chiaia by five o'clock . 
Would I like to see San Martino ? 
No , I answered , with decision , I had already been to San Martino ; I wished to go back to the Chiaia . 
Then - for astuteness commend me to a Neapolitan vetturino - that irritating creature became suddenly deaf , dumb , and blind , while his horse went on and on up the heights toward San Martino . 
Fortunately , the road winds around the hill , and as we reached one of its windings I saw , by a sign , that we were on the Strada Vittorio Emanuele . 
Hope revived when I began to recognize familiar buildings ; we would soon reach our hotel . " 
Hotel B. ! 
Albergo B. ! " 
I cried , with so much insistence and with gestures so like his own that the creature finally listened to me , the horse slackened its pace slightly , and then , oh joy ! 
the Hotel B. appeared , the concierge at the door . 
I called to him , he made a peremptory sign to the driver to stop , and I was once again a free woman , standing on my two feet , with solid ground beneath them . 
My Jehu now regained the use of his tongue , and unblushingly insisted upon a two hours ' fee for the drive of a trifle over an hour which I had been coerced into taking . 
The sum was not extortionate , according to American ideas , but no one wishes to be cheated , especially with one 's eyes wide open . 
I protested , explained the state of affairs to the concierge , when , to my surprise , he , my ally and champion as I had thought him , deserted me at this critical moment and joined the enemy , saying , " The signorina would do well to pay the vetturino what he asks , as according to the signorina 's own watch she has had the cab over an hour . " 
My humiliation was great when I handed the triumphant cabman his ill-gotten gains , but greater still was my disappointment over the defection of the concierge , whom we have all trusted . 
It seems , indeed , as if every man 's hand is against us in this beautiful city , from the salesman who tries to sell us imperfect coral to the crafty vendor of fruit who slips bad oranges into a paper bag for us , while he tries to distract our attention by sentimental remarks on the weather and the " bella vista . " 
Rather than trust myself to the mercy of another cabman , I ignominiously made my way down the many steps of the terrace to the street below , where I took a tram to the Chiaia . 
Angela was seated in the carriage , looking around anxiously , while Zelphine was walking up and down the pavement , both evidently much disturbed , wondering what had detained me . " 
There is still time to take the drive , " I said , in reply to their eager questions . " 
I saw a number of carriages coming down by the Square of the Martyrs . 
Get in , Zelphine , and I will explain my delay as we drive along . " 
All Naples seemed to be en voiture , this afternoon , and it was pleasant to be making a course with the languid , dark-eyed ladies and their attendant cavaliers , even if we were not intimately associated with them .

Anarchists Demand Strike To End War 
The Harlem River Casino , at 126th Street and Second Avenue , was the scene last night of a wild anti-conscription demonstration , in the course of which the Government of the United States was denounced and referred to as a tool of the capitalist classes . 
Young men liable to military service under the selective draft act were urged to defy the Government and refuse to serve if called to the colors . 
A general strike on the part of all working people as a protest against the entry of the country into the European war , and a nation-wide campaign to frustrate the efforts of the Government to raise armies for the defense of the country 's rights would be among the things the future has in store for the country if those who packed the Casino had their way . 
An appeal to the workingmen to follow the example of the Russians and form a workingmen 's committee to run the country was also urged . 
The meeting was addressed by anarchists , I. W. W. agitators , and persons who styled themselves Socialists . 
Emma Goldman was one of them . 
Alexander Berkman , who served a term in the penitentiary for attempting to assassinate Henry C. Frick , was another . 
Leonard D. Abbott , well known as an I. W. W. sympathizer , was another . 
Harry Weissberger , who says no power on earth can make him fight , was another . 
Also present and among the talkers was Leonora O'Reilly , while among those listed but who did not speak was Carlo Tresca , the Italian I. W. W. leader , and Jacob Panken . 
Outside the building and inside were about [1?]00 policemen , who had been instructed to preserve order . 
They made no arrests , although rumors flew about the hall that an arrest was impending , especially while Emma Goldman was talking . 
She was the one who predicted a nationwide strike to embarrass the Government and denounced the authorities in Washington as being on a par with the old powers in Russia . 
She begged the audience to make no hostile demonstration should anybody try to create disorder by " waving the American flag . " 
Two police stenographers , sitting in the gallery , took down every word said by the speakers . 
These notes will be gone over today , and , if a digest of the speeches seems to warrant it , action against the speakers may be taken , either by the police or by the Federal authorities . 
As each person entered the hall , he or she was presented with two circulars . 
In one , captioned " No conscription , " the " No Conscription League , " of 20 East 125th Street , exhorted young men to resist the enforcement of the selective draft . 
The other was an appeal to the workers of the country to follow the example of Russia and form a Council of Workers to act with the Council of Workmen 's and Soldiers ' Delegates of Russia against the war . 
According to the public announcement of Emma Goldman , the meeting was not financed by German money . 
" The Kaiser , " she shouted , " has not put up a cent for the cause . " 
However , there were many Germans in the audience . 
An interested onlooker was former Coroner Gustav Scholer . 
Dr. Scholer had a seat in the wings of the stage , out of the view of the audience . 
When Elihu Root 's name as head of the American Commission to Russia was mentioned by Emma Goldman , hisses came from every part of the hall . 
Weissberger , who talked first , spoke until he became so hoarse he had to quit . 
After him came Louis Frana , introduced as a Socialist of nation-wide prominence . 
He said the motto of all the people should from this on be , " They shall not conscript . " 
He referred to the Wilson Administration as " the government of the classes , which is introducing into this country a system of government which , among other things , seeks to destroy individual liberty and expression of thought . " 
Frana said the war was not a war for democracy , but a war to protect the war profits of the ruling classes . 
As he spoke somebody shouted that " it was a dastardly lie " to say that the United States went to war to save democracy , whereupon everybody , it seemed , shouted his or her approval . 
The document circulated among those in the audience calling for a workmen 's council in America in part read : 
Fellow-workers of the United States , why do n't you do the same thing here that your brother-workers are doing in Russia ? 
Why should n't the same " wonderful and heartening things that have been happening in Russia " begin to happen right here ? 
Are we workers of America going to let the workers and soldiers of Russia do the only wonderful and heartening things that are being done ? 
President Wilson has said that America stands supremely for peace . 
And yet today the only place in Christendom where a single step is being taken toward peace is RUSSIA . 
War has come to a standstill in Russia . 
The Russian workers are seeking for peace in this world . 
Workers of America , what are you going to do ? 
It is n't enough for you to refuse to fight , to resist conscription , to denounce the Government . 
It is the business of American workers to do what their Russian brothers have done . 
The only enemies American workers have are in America , are the men who have taken the land , who are taking enormous profits from their toil , and who have them imprisoned or shot when they rebel -- as has been done in West Virginia , in Colorado , in California , in Massachusetts , in a thousand places where the workers have rebelled against slavery and injustice . 
Let the workers of the United States at once follow the " heartening " example of their Russian brothers and form a nation-wide " Council of Workers , " which shall work hand in hand with " the Council of Workmen and Soldiers " in Russia against a war that cripples or kills millions of working people and enriches a few capitalists , and inaugurate here , as in Russia , the reign of freedom , justice and peace . 
The purposes of the No-conscription League were set forth in its circular in part as follows : 
" We oppose conscription because we are internationalists , anti-militarists , and opposed to all wars waged by capitalistic Governments . 
We will fight for what we choose to fight for , we will never fight simply because we are ordered to fight . 
" We believe that the militarization of America is an evil that far outweighs , in its anti-social and anti-libertarian effects , any good that may come from America 's participation in the war . 
" We will resist conscription by every means in our power , and we will sustain those who , for similar reasons , refuse to be conscripted . 
" Resist conscription . 
Organize meetings . 
Join our league . 
Send us money . 
Help us to give assistance to those who come in conflict with the Government . 
Help us to publish literature against militarism and against conscription . " 
Other meetings similar to that of last night will b held in other parts of the city shortly , it was announced . 1902 
AUTOMOBILE RACE ENDED . 
Renault Finished First and Three Contestants Claim the Honors in Paris-Vienna Contest . 
VIENNA , June 29 , - 
The Paris-Vienna automobile race was finished here to-day . 
Marcel Renault arrived first , but was disqualified . 
He covered the distance from Paris to Vienna in 15 hours and 22 minutes , at an average speed of 82 kilometres ( about 51 miles ) an hour . 
Zborowski was second , Maurice Farman third , Baras fourth , Edmond fifth , and Hemery sixth . 
Baron de Forest , who was seventh , was disqualified . 
On account of an accident to his motor car , S. F. Edge , an Englishman , was the twentieth to arrive . 
He denies reports circulated to the effect that he was disqualified , and cites as proof that he was declared winner of the James Gordon Bennett Cup . 
Three of the contestants in the race claim to have won . 
Renault passed the winning point precisely at 2 o’clock . 
He was disqualified , however , for having failed to stop at the control station at Florisdorf , a suburb of Vienna , across the Danube , where the final racing time was to be taken . 
Instead , he dashed madly through the crowd of officials and timekeepers , and entered Vienna at full speed , scattering vehicles and pedestrians in all directions , and arriving at the Prater in eighteen minutes instead of the prescribed minimum of forty-five minutes from Florisdorf . 
Zborowsky , although he arrived second , is believed to be too heavily handicapped by his previous day ’s performance to win first place . 
It is expected that Maurice Farman will attain the coveted honor , his brother Henry coming second . 
The decision will probably be delayed three days , owing to the complicated calculations arising from the speed restrictions imposed upon the contestants in Switzerland and elsewhere along the route . 
The final stage of the race was favored with glorious weather . 
Spectators lined the route for many miles into the country . 
The Austrian Automobile Club received the racers at Prater , where thousands of persons had gathered and cheered the arrivals . 
Much sympathy was expressed over the ill-luck which befell the American representatives . 
The Englishmen who took part in the contest were also unfortunate . 
It is asserted that Edge , who was believed to have won the James Gordon Bennett Prize , will be disqualified on account of having received help from some peasants in extricating his machine from a bad place on the road . 
The International Committee will investigate the charges . 
In the opinion of experts the race was the severest test of the capacity of automobiles ever imposed , the participants declaring that the roads over the Arlberg Pass and thence to Vienna are some of the worst in Europe . 
Every automobile covering the entire route in any reasonable time will be entitled to a place in the first rank of manufactures . 
A striking feature of the race has been the success and endurance of the light cars , especially in mountain work .

Battle of Raid Squads 
John M. Tully and Albert Raithel , revenue officers from St. Louis , may die , and two city detectives narrowly escaped injury as a result of a revolver battle yesterday through a case of mistaken identity . 
Tully and Raithel had gone to raid a house at 2743 Mercier street , reported to be a rendezvous for drug users . 
Edward Kritser and Paul Conrad , city detectives , arrived a few minutes later on the same mission . 
Each party of officers mistook the other for drug peddlers . 
Tully was shot in the right leg , left arm and lower abdomen . 
Raithel was wounded in the abdomen and left wrist . 
Both will recover . 
The two detectives were uninjured , but both had bullet holes through their clothing . 
The wounded men were taken to the General Hospital . 
Later they were removed to the Swedish Hospital . 
While on the surface the shooting of the two government officers appeared to be a case of mistaken identity , elements of a mysterious nature which Francis M. Wilson , United States district attorney , refused to make public , crept into the case last night . 
At 11 o'clock last night the district attorney took a statement from Tully . 
He said he could not disclose its contents . 
It was admitted by another government official there was " something back of the whole affair . " 
It was said all of the evidence with regard to the shooting and developments leading to the affair will be placed before Hunt C. Moore , prosecutor . 
Senator Wilson said the government would co-operate with the prosecutor . 
The district attorney conferred two hours last night with Chief Flahive and John Halpin , police commissioner . 
At the close Senator Wilson said he felt certain the prosecuting attorney would do his duty in the case . 
Tully gave this story of the shooting : 
" Raithel and I received information that there was a nest of drug addicts at a house at 2743 Mercier Street . 
We secured a search warrant from S.O. Hargis , assistant United States district attorney , and went out . 
In the house was an old woman . 
We ques tioned her and could learn nothing , so left to watch the house and question a few of the neighbors . 
We were standing across the street when a motor car drove up and two men and a girl got out . 
One of the men carried a handbag . 
Raithel and I thought they were ` dope heads . ' 
I w ent to the front door and Raithel to the rear . 
Inside the door I saw Bernie Lamar 's girl . 
She said , ` Hello Jack . ' 
Then a man stepped out of the next room . 
I walked up to him and touched him on the shoulder , saying , ` Hold on a minute , I 'm an officer . ' 
Then he started shooting . 
He got me in the arm . 
I shot twice and then got out the door . 
I got across the street and fell in front of a house . 
Then the other man shot me again . 
I emptied my revolver and then staggered over to a garage acro ss the road . " 
Raithel was operated on as soon as he was taken to the hospital and was unable to make a statement . 
The two detectives told a different story . 
According to them the battle was the culmination of a feud between a gang of drug addicts and government agents . 
About seven months ago Bernard Abe , a notorious police character , was sent to the Fort Leavenworth prison for drug peddling . 
John Tully had secured the evidence that convicted Aberer . 
His wife , Rose Aberer , alias Rose Fuqua , known as Rose Lamar , has been living here with a man named William " Irish " Rogers , also a drug addict and holder of a police record . 
When Tully arrested Aberer the government secured a large quantity of narcotics . 
Lately the federal officials here have been trailing Rose Fuqua , trying to locate the rest of the big supply of drugs which she was believed to have hidden . 
Two special agents were sent from the St. Louis office to aid in the work . 
Friday night Rose Fuqua and Williams were shadowed to the Stratford Hotel , 616 East Eighth Street , where they registered as Mr. and Mrs. William Sullivan . 
Yesterday the revenue office obtained two detectives from police headquarters to aid in raiding the room at the Stratford . 
Kritser and Conrad were assigned . 
Rose , a man named Richard C. Adams , and Rogers were arrested in the room and a quantity of narcotics found . 
The woman confessed to the government agents that the missing drugs were hidden in her mother 's home at 2743 Mercier Street . 
The city detectives took her and Rodgers out to the address . 
Conrad and Kritzer found a sack containing a quantity of heroin , morphine , opium and two complete " hop smoking " outfits hidden in the house . 
Conrad says he was talking to Rose Fuqua in the front room of the 5-room frame house when he heard a knock o n the door . 
A man entered . 
The woman said , " Hello , Jack , how are you ? " 
Conrad said in a sworn statement . 
" I concluded from the familiar way he spoke to her that he was a member of the gang , " the detective said . 
" The man turned to me and said ` Who are you ? ' 
reached for his revolver and reached for my shoulder . 
I drew my revolver and fired twice . 
He sho t at me three times . 
One bullet went through my coat , another grazed the side of my face . 
My shot struck him and he reeled out of the front door . 
Another man ( Raithel ) shot at me through the window . 
I fired three times and then went behind a door to reload my gun . 
" I heard someone shooting in the rear of the house and saw Kritser shooting at a man across the street . 
I stepped around and exchanged shots with a man shooting from behind a grocery wagon . 
I thought we were fighting a gang of dope fiends and rushed to the next house on the north , firing as I went . 
Kritser and I both shot at a man firing across the street . 
The small man dropped . 
Someone yelled , ` They 're government men . ' 
We stopped firing . 
Neither one of them said anything about being officers to me . " 
Kritser 's story and that told by Rose Fuqua agreed with Conrad 's . 
Rose Fuqua and Rogers escaped in the fight , but later gave themselves up . 
Buddie , a dog owned by Rogers , was shot in the leg and is being taken care of by a neighbor . 
Adams , Rogers , and Rose Fuqua are being held at police headquarters for investigation .

BLIND IN LEFT EYE , ROOSEVELT ADMITS 
Colonel Reveals That He Lost Sight of Organ in Boxing Bout Years Ago . 
WINDS UP TRAINING WORK 
Reduced in Weight and Girth , He Distances Mayor Mitchel in a Half-Mile Spurt . 
Special to The New York Times . 
STAMFORD , Conn. , Oct. 21 . 
— Weighing 202 pounds and with a waist measure of 42 ¾ inches Colonel Roosevelt received newspaper reporters and posed for moving picture photographers this afternoon at Jack Cooper 's Health Farm in North Stamford Avenue . 
In the course of an interview which he gave he revealed the interesting fact that while boxing in the White House with a young artillery officer , the latter by a blow broke a blood vessel in the President 's left eye and he had been blind in that eye ever since . 
When the Colonel began his course of treatment at the farm on Oct. 8 he weighed 216 pounds and his waist line measured 46 inches . 
During the two weeks his daily schedule has been this : Arise , 7:30 ; breakfast , 8:15 ; attend to correspondence until 10 ; four miles brisk walking on a half-mile track , followed in the gymnasium by shadow boxing , abdominal exercises , and baths until 12:15 ; luncheon at 1:15 . 
After another period for his correspondence the track and gymnasium exercises of the forenoon were repeated . 
Dinner was served at 6:45 , and every night at 9 the Colonel went for a two-mile walk . 
He was thoroughly massaged before retiring at 10 . 
He ate whatever he wanted and as much as he wanted . 
The Colonel this afternoon posed for the camera men with William Warren Barbour , a wealthy New York man , who some years ago won the amateur heavyweight boxing championship of America ; Mayor Mitchel of New York , A. McAfee , a copper dealer , and William Ziegler , the baking powder man . 
He wore khaki knickerbockers , an olive-drab army shirt , reddish-brown woolen stockings , and tan army shoes , and was without a hat . 
After posing for the cameras the Colonel , with Mr. Barbour and Gus Navka , a trainer , started on a circuit of the half-mile track , which was a sort of dash up and down hills and through cabbage patches along the borders of a lake . 
He hit up so fast a pace that Mayor Mitchel turned back before half the circuit had been made , and the newspaper men and onlookers were all winded when the dash was over . 
Poses for Cameras . 
A large crowd of Stamford people who had learned of the session with the newspaper men were on hand , among them Mayor Treat . 
They applauded Colonel Roosevelt , and he posed for many of the spectators who had cameras . 
He stopped to chat with the Rev. J. J. McGuane a Catholic priest , who is taking treatment at the place , and then escorted the newspaper men through the gymnasium . 
Later at the Cooper House he gave an interview . 
Colonel Roosevelt began the interview with a denial of a statement of a clergyman who was quoted under date of Oct. 19 from Atlantic City as saying that the ex-President had announced he would be unable to keep a tentative speaking engagement there tonight because his physician had ordered him to cancel all speaking engagements and take a complete rest . 
" That , " said Colonel Roosevelt , " is a complete fake . 
They asked me to speak , and I declined . 
I have n't seen a physician for months . 
No human being told me either to cancel a speaking engagement or to take a complete rest . " 
The Colonel had some notes jotted down on a piece of paper and he referred to them occasionally as he went on with his talk . 
" The gentlemen with whom you saw me having my picture taken today are old friends of mine . 
If I had been allowed to raise a division , Mr. McAfee would have held a commission under me , and Mr. Zeigler would have been with me . 
" I do n't know if any of you have ever taken any interest in boxing . 
I may say Warren Barbour here is the ex-amateur heavyweight champion of America . 
I think in the entire history of the prize ring Mr. Barbour is the one amateur I ever knew who , in his time , was a little better than the best professional . 
I was very anxious after he won the amateur heavyweight championship to have Warren Barbour go into the ring against Jack Johnson . 
I would have bet everything I could afford to put up on Warren Barbour . 
I have seen all the champions in the last thirty years . 
Only one man , in his prime was , I think , better than Mr. Barbour . 
He was John L. Sullivan . 
" When I was young , I was fond of outdoor life . 
I used to do considerable boxing , and I wrestled quite a bit . 
I had gradually to give these exercises up . 
The last time I wrestled was when I was in Albany as Governor of New York State . 
A lightweight champion , I think his name was Leonard , used to work with me . 
He had to go away , and then I had a professional oarsman as wrestling partner . 
Leonard was so good he could take care of me and himself . 
But the first afternoon that the professional oarsman and myself got down to business on the mat one of my short ribs and two of his long ones were broken . 
After that we called it off . 
" I kept up my boxing longer . 
When I was President I used to box with one of my aids , a young Captain in the artillery . 
One day he cross-countered me and broke a blood vessel in my left eye . 
I do n't know whether this is known , but I never have been able to see out of that eye since . 
I thought that as only one good eye was left me I would not box any longer . " 
" Is there any especial significance in the presence of Mayor Mitchel here ? " asked a reporter . 
" No , " he answered . 
" I am going to make certain speeches for him . " 
Replying to other questions , Colonel Roosevelt said he had done " a certain amount of writing " while at the health farm , and that he would return to Oyster Bay in a day or two . 
He also told the reporters jokingly that after he had become a " cub reporter " on The Kansas City Star he received a cablegram from the American correspondents with Pershing 's army " welcoming " him . 
Colonel Roosevelt assured the newspaper men there was no military significance in his training stunts . 
" I 'm going home to live as quietly as I can , " he said .

Buffalo Men at the Execution 
Sheriff Caldwell and Charles R. Huntley Saw Czolgosz Die . 
Their Impressions 
Both Say that Czolgosz Gave No Evidence of Fear in the Death Chamber 
Did Not Utter a Groan 
Sheriff Caldwell and Charles R. Huntley returned from Auburn shortly after 1 o'clock this afternoon , having witnessed the execution of Leon F. Czolgosz , the slayer of President McKinley . 
Asked about the execution , Mr. Huntley said to a Commercial reporter : 
" There is really little to be said about it . 
The case has been described correctly in the newspapers . 
I read them on my way up from Auburn and find that they picture the proceeding accurately . 
Czolgosz did not show any signs of fear and he did not tremble or turn pale ; he walked into the death room between two men , and walked with a firm step . 
He stumbled as he came into the room but did not fall , nor did his knees weaken . 
I was quite surprised at his demeanor , as was everyone else , I should say . 
He was perfectly strong and calm . 
He just slid himself into the chair exactly as a man might who expected to enjoy a half hour 's repose . 
The fact that in a moment a death current was to be forced through him did not seem to perturb him in the least . 
" Yes , I heard him make the statements accredited to him . 
He spoke very plainly and in a voice which did not waver in the slightest degree . 
He said first that he was not sorry for having killed the President , and , as the straps which bound his jaws were put in place , he said that he was sorry he could not see his father . 
Everyone in the room must have heard and understood him . 
He had expressed a desire to speak , so it was claimed , after getting in the presence of the witnesses . 
He wanted everyone to hear him . 
It was supposed , therefore , that whatever talking he intended to do he would do before getting into the chair . 
It was a general surprise to hear his voice after the men had begun to affix the electrodes . 
The witnesses were somewhat startled and were amazed at the man 's calmness . 
We all kept our eyes on him and listened most attentively . 
But the men at work beside him and in front , of him did not pause . 
They kept on affixing the appliances . 
Evidently Czolgosz had prepared something to say and what he said was part of his prepared piece . 
That is my thought of the matter . 
I would n't say that he tried to make a hero of himself . 
There was no spirit of bravado manifest at all . 
He said a few things just as if he felt it his duty to say them . " 
" Did , he tremble or grow pale as the straps were put in place ? " was asked . 
" No , not at all . 
He was collected and calm every moment , to all appearances . 
Sheriff Caldwell , who was with me , said he looked better and more self-possessed than he looked during the trial here in Buffalo . 
His face had the normal amount of color in it , and his hands did n't tremble a bit . 
" The majesty of the law was perfectly sustained , " continued Mr. Huntley . 
" There was n't a hitch anywhere and not an incident which could merit the faintest criticism . 
Czolgosz was sentenced to die in the electric chair , and his death was effected quickly and certainly . 
It was but an incredibly short time after the murderer walked into the death chamber when the doctors in attendance pronounced him dead . 
There had been no scene ; no one had fainted or grown excited . 
Everyone conducted himself with remarkable sang-froid . 
The attendants were busy right up to the moment of turning on the current , and had but stepped back when the body of the assassin was in the grasp of the powerful current . 
As I have said , not a thing marred the formality . 
Everything went off smoothly , according to a schedule carefully planned . " 
Sheriff Samuel Caldwell was asked by a Commercial reporter as to his impressions of the execution of the assassin . 
He replied : 
" I was impressed with the idea that the assassin was a man of great nerve . 
Although guards had hold of his arms , the prisoner could have walked unaided to the chair . 
Aside from the prisoner 's last words , there was not a sound in the death chamber , and the prisoner himself gave no evidence of fear . 
" As soon as he had been seated in the chair and his face covered so that his nose and mouth were alone exposed , Warden Mead raised his hand and Electrician Davis turned on the current which snuffed out the prisoner 's life as with a snap of the finger . 
The electrician then felt the prisoner 's jugular vein . 
Dr. MacDonald did the same , and was followed by Prison Physician Gerin . 
The doctors then stepped back , and Warden Mead again raised his hand . 
Again the current was applied and was continued about 50 seconds . 
" When the electricity was again shut off , the physicians examined the body by the usual means , and at the end pronounced that the man was dead . 
The witnesses left the death chamber before the body was removed to the operating table in the autopsy room . 
I signed the document swearing that I saw the electrocution of the assassin . 
The doctors remained for the autopsy , but I came home immediately . 
" The prisoner 's nerve was evidenced by his conduct from the moment he entered the death chamber . 
No groan escaped him , and his lips did not even move except when he was making his final statement to the effect that he did not repent his crime . 
When the electricity entered the assassin 's body it stiffened with successive jerks , but death was so quick that he did not have time to groan . " CHAPTER I 
FROM NAPLES 
This is the third day of sirocco , heavy-clouded , sunless . 
All the colour has gone out of Naples ; the streets are dusty and stifling . 
I long for the mountains and the sea . 
To-morrow I shall leave by the Messina boat , which calls at Paola . 
It is now more than a twelvemonth since I began to think of Paola , and an image of the place has grown in my mind . 
I picture a little marina ; a yellowish little town just above ; and behind , rising grandly , the long range of mountains which guard the shore of Calabria . 
Paola has no special interest that I know of , but it is the nearest point on the coast to Cosenza , which has interest in abundance ; by landing here I make a modestly adventurous beginning of my ramble in the South . 
At Paola foreigners are rare ; one may count upon new impressions , and the journey over the hills will be delightful . 
Were I to lend ear to the people with whom I am staying , here in the Chiatamone , I should either abandon my project altogether or set forth with dire misgivings . 
They are Neapolitans of the better class ; that is to say , they have known losses , and talk of their former happiness , when they lived on the Chiaia and had everything handsome about them . 
The head of the family strikes me as a typical figure ; he is an elderly man , with a fine head , a dignified presence , and a coldly courteous demeanour . 
By preference he speaks French , and his favourite subject is Paris . 
One observes in him something like disdain for his own country , which in his mind is associated only with falling fortunes and loss of self-respect . 
The cordial Italian note never sounds in his talk . 
The signora ( also a little ashamed of her own language ) excites herself about taxation - as well she may - and dwells with doleful vivacity on family troubles . 
Both are astonished at my eccentricity and hardiness in undertaking a solitary journey through the wild South . 
Their geographical notions are vague ; they have barely heard of Cosenza or of Cotrone , and of Paola not at all ; it would as soon occur to them to set out for Morocco as for Calabria . 
How shall I get along with people whose language is a barbarous dialect ? 
Am I aware that the country is in great part pestilential ? 
- la febbre ! 
Has no one informed me that in autumn snows descend , and bury everything for months ? 
It is useless to explain that I only intend to visit places easily accessible , that I shall travel mostly by railway , and that if disagreeable weather sets in I shall quickly return northwards . 
They look at me dubiously , and ask themselves ( I am sure ) whether I have not some more tangible motive than a lover of classical antiquity . 
It ends with a compliment to the enterprising spirit of the English race . 
I have purchases to make , business to settle , and I must go hither and thither about the town . 
Sirocco , of course , dusks everything to cheerless grey , but under any sky it is dispiriting to note the changes in Naples . 
Lo sventramento ( the disembowelling ) goes on , and regions are transformed . 
It is a good thing , I suppose , that the broad Corso Umberto I. should cut a way through the old Pendino ; but what a contrast between that native picturesqueness and the cosmopolitan vulgarity which has usurped its place ! " 
Napoli se ne va ! " 
I pass the Santa Lucia with downcast eyes , my memories of ten years ago striving against the dulness of to-day . 
The harbour , whence one used to start for Capri , is filled up ; the sea has been driven to a hopeless distance beyond a wilderness of dust-heaps . 
They are going to make a long , straight embankment from the Castel dell ' Ovo to the Great Port , and before long the Santa Lucia will be an ordinary street , shut in among huge houses , with no view at all . 
Ah , the nights that one lingered here , watching the crimson glow upon Vesuvius , tracing the dark line of the Sorrento promontory , or waiting for moonlight to cast its magic upon floating Capri ! 
The odours remain ; the stalls of sea-fruit are as yet undisturbed , and the jars of the water-sellers ; women still comb and bind each other 's hair by the wayside , and meals are cooked and eaten al fresco as of old . 
But one can see these things elsewhere , and Santa Lucia was unique . 
It has become squalid . 
In the grey light of this sad billowy sky , only its ancient foulness is manifest ; there needs the golden sunlight to bring out a suggestion of its ancient charm . 
Has Naples grown less noisy , or does it only seem so to me ? 
The men with bullock carts are strangely quiet ; their shouts have nothing like the frequency and spirit of former days . 
In the narrow and thronged Strada di Chiaia I find little tumult ; it used to be deafening . 
Ten years ago a foreigner could not walk here without being assailed by the clamour of cocchieri ; nay , he was pursued from street to street , until the driver had spent every phrase of importunate invitation ; now , one may saunter as one will , with little disturbance . 
Down on the Piliero , whither I have been to take my passage for Paola , I catch but an echo of the jubilant uproar which used to amaze me . 
Is Naples really so much quieter ? 
If I had time I would go out to Fuorigrotta , once , it seemed to me , the noisiest village on earth , and see if there also I observed a change . 
It would not be surprising if the modernization of the city , together with the state of things throughout Italy , had a subduing effect upon Neapolitan manners . 
In one respect the streets are assuredly less gay . 
When I first knew Naples one was never , literally never , out of hearing of a hand-organ ; and these organs , which in general had a peculiarly dulcet note , played the brightest of melodies ; trivial , vulgar if you will , but none the less melodious , and dear to Naples . 
Now the sound of street music is rare , and I understand that some police provision long since interfered with the soft-tongued instruments . 
I miss them ; for , in the matter of music , it is with me as with Sir Thomas Browne . 
For Italy the change is significant enough ; in a few more years spontaneous melody will be as rare at Naples or Venice as on the banks of the Thames . 
Happily , the musicians errant still strum their mandoline as you dine . 
The old trattoria in the Toledo is as good as ever , as bright , as comfortable . 
I have found my old corner in one of the little rooms , and something of the old gusto for zuppa di vongole . 
The homely wine of Posillipo smacks as in days gone by , and is commended to one 's lips by a song of the South ... 
Last night the wind changed and the sky began to clear ; this morning I awoke in sunshine , and with a feeling of eagerness for my journey . 
I shall look upon the Ionian Sea , not merely from a train or a steamboat as before , but at long leisure : I shall see the shores where once were Tarentum and Sybaris , Croton and Locri . 
Every man has his intellectual desire ; mine is to escape life as I know it and dream myself into that old world which was the imaginative delight of my boyhood . 
The names of Greece and Italy draw me as no others ; they make me young again , and restore the keen impressions of that time when every new page of Greek or Latin was a new perception of things beautiful . 
The world of the Greeks and Romans is my land of romance ; a quotation in either language thrills me strangely , and there are passages of Greek and Latin verse which I can not read without a dimming of the eyes , which I can not repeat aloud because my voice fails me . 
In Magna Graecia the waters of two fountains mingle and flow together ; how exquisite will be the draught ! 
I drove with my luggage to the Immacolatella , and a boatman put me aboard the steamer . 
Luggage , I say advisedly ; it is a rather heavy portmanteau , and I know it will be a nuisance . 
But the length of my wanderings is so uncertain , its conditions are so vaguely anticipated . 
I must have books if only for rainy days ; I must have clothing against a change of season . 
At one time I thought of taking a mere wallet , and now I am half sorry that I altered my mind . 
But ---- We were not more than an hour after time in starting . 
Perfect weather . 
I sang to myself with joy upon the sunny deck as we steamed along the Bay , past Portici , and Torre del Greco , and into the harbour of Torre Annunziata , where we had to take on cargo . 
I was the only cabin passenger , and solitude suits me . 
All through the warm and cloudless afternoon I sat looking at the mountains , trying not to see that cluster of factory chimneys which rolled black fumes above the many-coloured houses . 
They reminded me of the same abomination on a shore more sacred ; from the harbour of Piraeus one looks to Athens through trails of coal-smoke . 
By a contrast pleasant enough , Vesuvius to-day sent forth vapours of a delicate rose-tint , floating far and breaking seaward into soft little fleeces of cirrus . 
The cone , covered with sulphur , gleamed bright yellow against cloudless blue . 
The voyage was resumed at dinner-time ; when I came upon deck again , night had fallen . 
We were somewhere near Sorrento ; behind us lay the long curve of faint-glimmering lights on the Naples shore ; ahead was Capri . 
In profound gloom , though under a sky all set with stars , we passed between the island and Cape Minerva ; the haven of Capri showed but a faint glimmer ; over it towered mighty crags , an awful blackness , a void amid constellations . 
From my seat near the stern of the vessel I could discern no human form ; it was as though I voyaged quite alone in the silence of this magic sea . 
Silence so all-possessing that the sound of the ship 's engine could not reach my ear , but was blended with the water-splash into a lulling murmur . 
The stillness of a dead world laid its spell on all that lived . 
To-day seemed an unreality , an idle impertinence ; the real was that long-buried past which gave its meaning to all around me , touching the night with infinite pathos . 
Best of all , one 's own being became lost to consciousness ; the mind knew only the phantasmal forms it shaped , and was at peace in vision . 
Chapter XIX . 
Rome to Brindisi . 
From Rome I went to Pompeii , stopping long enough at Naples , however , to learn that the impudence of the pestiferous porters is quite unendurable . 
Italy throughout is much infested with porters , but in the southern section of the peninsula they are a regular pest , which at times becomes epidemic . 
During the traveling season it seems as if everybody was a porter . 
Sometimes they will surround the traveler and assail him on every side , asking him to let them carry his baggage . 
Sometimes I found them to be of great service in finding hotels for me , but at other times I was much inconvenienced by their attacks . 
I think it was at Naples , where a dozen or more of them yelled at me all at the same time , each desirous of carrying my satchel . 
As none of them could speak in a language that I understood , I declined to let any one have it . 
Each one evinced his earnestness by taking hold of my baggage while asking for it . 
After taking turns at their chances in this way for a while , at the same time crowding the path in front of me so that I could not proceed , one of them in his greediness almost tore my satchel out of my hands , I responded to his supplication with such a tremendous no , that the next fellow assumed a stooping posture and asked me in a whisper ! 
These people deserve our pity rather than censure . 
Many of them are evidently sometimes in a famishing condition . 
But few who have not seen , can form an idea of the poverty which reigns in some sections of Southern Italy , especially between Naples and Brindisi . 
I saw children running about in this section , that had little of clothing save a shirt , which was generally torn in every part ; some few , below the age of about six or eight years , had not even a thread of clothing upon their bodies . 
An elderly man that was plowing with a pair of oxen , as is the custom in Italy , was accompanied by his wife who was well dressed , but he wore only a shirt that reached to his knees , and a hat . 
I spent a Sunday at Brindisi , and observed that people keep no Sunday there . 
All the people wear old and tattered garments , and I could not see a hat , a coat or a pair of pantaloons on the person of one of the hundreds that thronged the market-place all Sunday , that looked as if it had been new at any time within the last few years ! 
The railroad tunnels are even more numerous than in the Black Forest . 
In some places it becomes impossible to read in the cars , as the train is much of the time under the mountains . 
From the window of the cars I saw a man with his bare feet in a tub treading grapes , for the purpose of making wine . 
It reminded me of the way , as it is said , some made their sourcrout in this country some forty-five or fifty years ago . 
I spent a day among the ruins of Pompeii and in the ascent of Mount Vesuvius . 
Pompeii was a town of about 30,000 inhabitants when it was destroyed by an eruption of old Vesuvius in A.D. 79 . 
On the 24th of August a dense shower of ashes covered the town 3 feet in thickness , but allowed the inhabitants time to escape . 
Only of those which returned to recover valuables , &amp; c. , were overtaken and covered by the shower of red hot rapilli , or fragments of pumice-stone , which , with succeeding showers of ashes , covered the town to the depth of 7-8 feet . " 
The present superincumbent mass is about 20 feet in thickness . " 
In the one third of the town already excavated the skeletons of some 500 have been found . 
Casts of bodies found in 1863 , were made by pouring plaster of Paris into the cavities where they had lain , and the figures of the deceased in their death-struggle are thus obtained . 
Bædeker devotes 25 pages to a description of the wonders and curiosities of this exhumed town . 
The ascent of Vesuvius required about six hours . 
We started at 6:30 in the morning and returned at 12:30 p.m . 
The distance from Pompeii , which stands at its foot , to the top of it is about 5 miles in a straight line , and eight miles by the paths . 
Mules can ascend half-way ; but I took a guide and walked the whole distance . 
At the point where the mules must be abandoned , a number of guides offered to carry me up , or to drag me up by means of a rope ! 
But I climbed it . 
A cloud hangs over it all the time , which is occasioned by the column of steam that issues from its crater . 
The entire upper part of the peak is perfectly bare of vegetation , and covered with fine cinders , rapilli , &amp; c. , through which escapes a gas that almost suffocates the ascending traveler . 
At the top we shouted into the crater and heard distinct echos after two seconds , which proves that the mouth of the crater reflected the sound at the depth of about 1,000 or 1,100 feet ! 
From Pompeii I returned to Naples and spent the night there . 
Early on Thursday morning I went to the " Stazione " ( Station ) and left for Brindisi . 
The temperature was 90 degrees in the shade , in the afternoon . 
Some people have constructed artificial caves which they use as stables , for their cattle ; and possibly some have such rude grottos for their homes !

Crowd Endangers Steamer to Get Passing Glimpse of Humorist Mark Twain 
Collision Between Steamer Sylvester and Yacht Kanawha Narrowly Averted 
-- Author Responds To Calls . 
It was a very close shave that the steamer John Sylvester had yesterday morning as she was proceeding down the river for the exposition grounds with 1,200 people aboard . 
The steam came within an ace of colliding with H. H. Rogers ' steam-yacht the Kanawha . 
It was a frightened crown of passengers for a short time . 
The yacht was clearly at fault . 
If the vessels had come together it would have been what is known as a " sideswipe " collision . 
It is a question as to which vessel would have gotten the worse of it . 
Crowd Wanted to See Mark . 
The Sylvester was just below Fort Norfolk making pretty good time when the Kanawha crept up on the steamer . 
As it had been printed that Mark Twain , the famous humorist , was aboard the Standard Oil magnate 's vessel , the passengers on the steamer all seemed to get on the starboard side of the vessel , which caused her to careen . 
There were cries for Twain . 
The skipper of the yacht heard them and it appeared that he tried to run his vessel as close to the steam as possible . 
The master of the yacht evidently did not count on the current for the yacht was swept close to the steamer and it appeared that a collision was inevitable . 
Seeing the danger , the master of the yacht steered away and soon the vessels were far apart . 
Mr. Clemens , whose nom de plume is Mark Twain , heard the shouting . 
He had been seen in the saloon of the yacht , his thick , bushy white locks standing out plainly through the windows . 
The demand for his presence on the deck was so great that the famous writer came out , took off his hat and bowed . 
A mighty shout went up from the passengers on the steamer . 
Then Mark retired . 
He wore that famous white suit . 
On his head was a yachting cap . 
The yacht anchored near the warships . 
Second Narrow Escape . 
While the Sylvester was going through the long lane of warships in the Roads she had another narrow escape from colliding , this time with the yacht Embia , of New York . 
Again it was the fault of the other vessel , for the yacht tried to cross the bow of the steamer . 
The captain of the steamer exercised rare judgment and maneuvered his vessel so that she steered clear of the white flyer that got in her way . 
The police lines in the Roads were drawn tight . 
The Sylvester had n't proceeded far before a navy launch hove in sight and the commander through the megaphone warned the master of the steamer not to get within the lines . 
October 19 1917 
Death Comes to Mata Hari 
Mata Hari , which is Javanese for Eye-of-the-Morning , is dead . 
She was shot as a spy by a firing squad of Zouaves at the Vincennes Barracks . 
She died facing death literally , for she refused to be blindfolded . 
Gertrud Margarete Zelle , for that was the real name of the beautiful Dutch-Javanese dancer , did appeal to President Poincaré for a reprieve , but he refused to intervene . 
The first intimation she received that her plea had been denied was when she was led at daybreak from her cell in the Saint-Lazare prison to a waiting automobile and then rushed to the barracks where the firing squad awaited her . 
Never once had the iron will of the the beautiful woman failed her . 
Father Arbaux , accomapanied by two sisters of charity , Captain Bouchardon , and Maître Clunet , her lawyer , entered her cell , where she was still sleeping — a calm , untroubled sleep , it was remarked by the turnkeys and trusties . 
The sisters gently shook her . 
She arose and was told that her hour had come . 
" May I write two letters ? " was all she asked . 
Consent was given immediately by Captain Bouchardon , and pen , ink , paper and envelopes were given to her . 
She seated herself at the edge of the bed and wrote the letters with feverish haste . 
She handed them over to the custody of her lawyer . 
Then she drew on her stockings , black , silken , filmy things , grotesque in the circumstances . 
She placed her high-heeled slippers on her feet and tied the silken ribbons over her insteps . 
She arose and took the long black velvet cloak , edged around the bottom with fur and with a huge square fur collar hanging down the back , from a hook over the head of her bed . 
she placed this cloak over the heavy silk kimono which she had been wearing over her nightdress . 
Her wealth of black hair was still coiled about her head in braids . 
She put on a large , flapping black felt hat with a black silk ribbon and bow . 
Slowly and indifferently , it seemed , she pulled on a pair of black kid gloves . 
Then she said calmly : " I am ready . " 
The party slowly filed out of her cell to the waiting automobile . 
The car sped through the heart of the sleeping city . 
It was scarcely half past five in the morning and the sun was not yet fully up . 
Clear across Paris the car whirled the Caserne de Vincennes , the barracks of the old fort which the Germans stormed in 1870 . 
The troops were already drawn up for the execution . 
The twelve Zouaves , forming the firing squad , stood in line , their rifles at ease . 
A subofficer stood behind them , sword drawn . 
The automobile stopped , and the party descended , Mata Hari last . 
The party walked straight to the spot , where a little hummock of earth reared itself seven or eight feet high and afforded a background for such bullets as might miss the human target . 
As Father Arbaux spoke with the condemned woman , a French officer approached , carrying a white cloth . 
" The blindfold , " he whispered to the nuns who stood there and handed it to them . 
" Must I wear that ? " asked Mata hari , turning to her lawyer , as her eyes glimpsed the blindfold . 
Maître Cluent turned interrogatively to the French officer . 
" If Madame prefers not , it makes no difference , " replied the officer , hurriedly turning away . 
Mata Hari was not bound and she was not blindfolded . 
She stood gazing steadfastly at her executioners , when the priest , the nuns , and her lawyer stepped away from her . 
The officer in command of the firing squad , who had been watching his men like a hawk that none might examine his rifle and try to find out whether he was destined to fire the blank cartridge which was in the breech of one rifle , seemed relieved that the business would soon be over . 
A sharp , crackling command , and the file of twelve men assumed rigid positions at attention . 
Another command , and their rifles were at their shoulders ; each man gazed down his barrel at the breast of the woman which was the target . 
She did not move a muscle . 
The underofficer in charge had moved to a position where from the corners of their eyes they could see him . 
His sword was etended in the air . 
It dropped . 
The sun — by this time up — flashed on the burnished blade as it described an arc in falling . 
Simultaneously the sound of the volley rang out . 
Flame and a tiny puff of greyish smoke issued from the muzzle of each rifle . 
Automatically the men dropped their arms . 
At the report Mata Hari fell . 
She did not die as actors and moving-picture stars would have us believe that people die when they are shot . 
She did not throw up her hands nor did she plunge straight forward or straight back . 
Instead she seemed to collapse . 
Slowly , inertly , she settled to her knees , her head up always , and without the slightest change of expression on her face . 
For the fraction of a second it seemed she tottered there , on her knees , gazing directly at those who had taken her life . 
Then she fell backward , bending at the waist , with her legs doubled up beneath her . 
She lay prone , motionless , with her face turned towards the sky . 
A non-commissioned officer , who accompanied a lieutenant , drew his revolver from the big , black holster strapped about his waist . 
Bending over , he placed the muzzle of the revolver almost - but not quite - against the left temple of the spy . 
He pulled the trigger , and the bullet tore into the brain of the woman . 
Mata Hari was surely dead .

Defense Committee Corners Supplies . 
LONDON , Sept. 13 . 
— Conditions in Constantinople are described as chaotic by Reuter 's correspondent in Athens , who bases his dispatch on statements made by person arriving in Athens today from the Turkish capital . 
The correspondents telegraphs : 
" The inhabitants of Constantinople are suffering greater hardships than is necessary , because the Committee of National Defense , run by Enver Pasha , Minister of War , and Taalat Bey , Minister of the Interior , has cornered all commodities and is selling them at high prices . 
" The resignation from the Cabinet of the Sheik ul Islam , representative of the Sultan in religious affairs , is confirmed . 
He disapproved of the extermination of the Christian elements , against which he protested to the Cabinet . 
The Greek-Armenian Patriarch has been deprived of all powers . 
" The Black Sea end of the Bosporus has been closed by a chain of wire netting and by mines . " 20th July , 1906 
Dr. Brooks Sees Comet 
GENEVA , N. Y. , July 19 . 
— Finley 's periodic comet , which was recently seen at Heidelberg , was observed by Dr. William R. Brooks , at Smith Observatory last night . 
Its position was 23 hours , 53 minutes , 30 seconds right ascension ; 13 degrees , 3 seconds declination south . 
It is on the tail of the constellation Cetus , and moving slowly northeast . 
The light of the comet is rather faint , but will increase in brightness until September , when the comet is nearest the sun . 31th December , 1911 
DR. SUN 'S ELECTION IS NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY 
SHANGHAI , Dec. 30 . 
Dr. Sun Yat-sen , interviewed here today by the correspondent of THE NEW YORK TIMES , said he accepts the Presidency not doubting that the convention will adopt a republican form of government and that conditions will quickly settle and trade revive . 
He expained that the beginning of the revolution was premature , but it had been carefully planned . 
He also was unable , he said , to outline any policy until his cabinet is organized . 
He will proceed to NanKing soon . 
Dr. Sun Yat-sen was elected by fifty delegates , who were not accredited except for letters from revolutionary provincial leaders . 
some of these already have been deposed , and one should not take too seriously the result which was partly due to a foreign intrigue which provoked the revolution first . 
Dr. Sun 's election , occuring simultaneously with the peace delegates agreeing to refer the form of government to the convention indicates a lack of harmony among the republicans , which partly stultifies the work of Dr. Wu Ting-Fang and apparently violates the understanding with Yuan Shi-Kai . 
The leaders will not admit that there are differences . 
All may be adjusted but the situation indicates that there will be a republic eventually , with Yuan Shi-Kai as president .

Easy Mark Twain 
The man whom a few people know as Samuel L. Clemens is an easy mark . 
That was demonstrated Thursday when he came here aboard the steam yacht Kanawha , as the guest of Henry H. Rogers , the Standard Oil Collossus , and talked when a newspaper reporter was within short ear shot . 
He seems to have none of that quality which one who wished to exhibit a deplorable lack in a fancy dress might well perhaps , call business acumen . 
Why everyone of those little words which slipped out of his mouth might have been sold for something . 
True , they were not exactly new words , but he could have dressed them up so no one would have known that they ever had been used and they could have been worked off at a good profit to the producer . 
Instead of the producer profiting , however , the public profited . 
That goes to show that a man may have the art to dress up old words in a new style and amuse the public immoderately and still be without business acumen . 
Men do not make money talking for nothing . 
Mark Twain , as he lies slumbering aboard the Kanawha , the breeze from the Dismal Swamp which Tom Moore peopled with the ghost of a maid which never ceases from paddling , fanning the sleeper , is surrounded by several luminous examples all pursuading to the contrary . 
Not all he said yesterday has yet blossomed into print either , but may be expected to be hoarded and retailed by the newspaper men slowly , so as to not break the market . 
He said something to the effect that some people here expressed concern lest the Jamestown Exposition should not be complete . 
Such a possibility as that , he could not comprehend in view of the fact that he really was the show and he was all here and it was all right . 
He allowed that his daughter once said that her Papa never went any where except it was some place where he could show himself off and he thought that he was doing that here pretty well . 
The reporters say that he said these things . 
Of course , the reporters sometimes misquote a man . 
Who has not known men whom they have quoted in print as saying something which sounded entirely different when read than when uttered . 
Fortunately for reporters the things which they write which please the public and make that public applaud the man who uttered them are rarely misquotations . 
Mark Twain , though , has rarely been misquoted . 
Perhaps the principal reason why this is true is that nobody else could think of anything which might be said which was so good as that which Mark Twain really said . 
He can say good things , there is n't any doubt of that , but that he has business acumen three is no earthly use of pretending . 
Perhaps it is because of this very lack that the world loves him so dearly . 
The crippled child generally is loved by the mother better than the perfect one is .

Edith Kingdon 
Jay Gould , Railroad Tycoon , Visits the City of Ottawa . 
A Millionaires Appearance . 
" The Boy " George and His Bonny Bride 
Not a solitary woman in this city was aware of the fact , until the Local-News appeared last night that Edith Kingdon , the actress , paid her first visit to Ottawa in her new role of Mrs. George J. Gould , yesterday afternoon . 
At twenty minutes past one in the afternoon , a special train consisting of the locomotive , a baggage car , a sleeper , a dining car and a regally decorated boudoir car arrived at the First street depot . 
The boudoir coach was the " Convoy , " Jay Gould 's personal car , and it brought to the city the railroad magnate , his son , George J. Gould , the latter 's wife , pretty Edith Kingdon that was ; H.S. Hopkins , second vice president of the Gould system ; Capt. Shackford , commander of Gould 's steam yatch the Atalanta , and officials of the M.P. system . 
Modesty cautions us not to mention that a Local-News reporter was also one of the party from the Osawatomie junction . 
The only other people on the car beside the trainmen , worthy of note were a conductor and a negro porter , who were duly impressed with the responsibilities of the positions they were occupying as menials to the great millionaire . 
The conductor was particularly enamored with himself and strutted about like a turkey gobler as the train halted here for twenty minutes , giving orders to every curious person who sought to gain a view of the glory of the interior of the car . 
Had it not been for his blue suit and brass buttons , the people would not doubt have taken him for the railroad magnate and Gould for the conductor . 
While waiting at the depot Messrs Gould and Hopkins engaged in conversation with station agent Lisk . 
The great railroad President has changed very little in the past few years . 
He still has the same sharp , black eye and his face wears its old time studious look . 
His full black beard has a considerable sprinkling of gray in it . 
He was dressed in a frock business suit of dark material , and wore a white crush - they call it " slouch " out here - hat , pulled down well over his forehead . 
George and his bride , who were greater objects of curiosity than the great financier , make quite a good looking couple . 
The young man is about twenty six years of age , somewhat taller than his father , but like him very slender . 
He has dark skin , jet black hair and moustache , and a dark brown eye . 
He wore a light frock suit of a small checked pattern , and a dark derby hat . 
While not exactly handsome , he is a rather a good looking young fellow , and has a very pleasant face . 
He walked about the platform , but was addressed by nobody . 
His wife looks enough like him to be taken for his sister . 
She is of a dark , olive complexion , and has a dark grey eye and dark hair . 
Her features are sharp and clean cut , and her mouth at times wears a pucker that is perfectly captivating . 
She can hardly be classed as a beauty , but is a certainly quite pretty , and has a most interesting and attractive face . 
Her tall , slender form was clad in a close fitting , neat tailor made traveling suit of dark blue woolen goods , ornamented with broad eroded trimmings . 
She donned a little black straw hat that was set off with a red wing and a bow of red ribbon as she stood upon the platform for a moment gazing with apparent interest at the little mill that is so great an eyesore to Supt. Leonard of the gas works , and carried in her hand a plain , wooden-handled red silk parasol . 
A foot that is not over small was encased in a low quartered shoe , just affording the slightest glimpse of a pretty ankle clad in black silk hose . 
To the representative of the press Mr. Gould , while courteous , showed little inclination to talk . 
The party , he said had been traveling the western roads controlled by him . 
There was no particular significance to the trip , it being a tour of inspection . 
His son was accompanying him on business also and had merely taken his bride along as she wanted to travel with him . 
Mr. Gould said he had no new pieces of railroad property in mind and contemplated no changes in the system . 
Vice President Hopkins was more talkative with respect to local interests . 
He manifested considerable interest in Ottawa , as evinced by his pertinent enquiries as to the volume of business done here , and how much of it his road is receiving . 
When interrogated as to whether or not the city would be made the end of a division he rather gave the impression that it was hardly probable . 
However if a proper spirit was shown by citizens , and the M.P. met half way and treated fairly by citizens - the company would most certainly do its share and put its properties in first-class condition . 
He said that in all likelihood the Topeka extension would be built in the immediate future , and smilingly intimated that shops would very probably be erected here . 
The party went out to the front of the Council Grove extension , and will return this evening . 
December 27 , 1892 
Edmonton Bulletin account of public meeting held during the 1893 Edmonton municipal election 
Mayor McCauley presided , and stated that the object of the meeting was for the ratepayers to express their grievances if they were dissatisfied with the actions of the old council . 
He viewed several transactions of the council during the past year , and when questioned about the ditch near the curling rink , he stated the object of the same , but did not know nor could not find out who gave the orders , but thought it was all right for him to sign the cheques for same . 
The bridge across the Rat creek was discussed to so some length , when he said that it was built and that he thought it was a good bridge , so he signed the cheques providing the work was stopped on the ditch . 
Jas . Goodridge was the next speaker , and said he did the very best he could and admitted that the council may have made mistakes , but no matter who that council was they would make more . 
J. A. McDougall was then called and explained about the trip of the delegates to Ottawa and what encouragements they got when they were in Ottawa . 
Mr. McDougall then viewed the council and their actions of the past year , while praising some he thought they did a good many foolish things . 
Mr. McDougall said , if elected , he would do all in his power to secure a traffic bridge across the Saskatchewan , if the town had to pay a half or more . 
He would try to have the best system of waterworks that could be had , and what was a benefit to the town would be his first and last demand , if elected . 
C. Gallagher was called upon and said he was not a public speaker , but ask the vote and influence of the ratepayers , and , if elected , would do the very best he could for the town . 
K. A. McLeod was called upon and said that he was not a public speaker , but that he was an old timer , his all was here , he came to stay , and that he was going to stay . 
His intentions were favorable to Mr. McDougall 's in regard to the bridge , and , if elected , would serve to the very best interests of the town . 
Geo P. Sanderson was called upon and said that he had been a kicker against the old council and that he was there to face anything he had said behind the boards . 
He condemned the council for the way in which they made the ditch , and that the water would not run up hill . 
He would guarantee that if a ditch was made 18 inches deep that there would be no surplus water on the low ground in which the present ditch was now made . 
He would , if elected , practice a little economy , not by salting every dollar in the treasury , but by careful handling for anything that would be a benefit to the town . 
He agreed with Mr. McDougall in regard to the building of the bridge , but would not go in for giving any bonus to a railway and and traffic bridge combined . 
He thought if the C.P.R. wanted to come into the town they were capable of so doing without the aid of the funds of the town . 
Some remarks made by Mr. Sanderson brought the mayor to his feet in defence of the old council , about the ditch between Namayo and Kinistino avenues , also the bridge on Kinistino avenue across Rat Creek in which no one seems to know anything why the work should have been done or who gave the orders for the same ; but the town paid for it all the same . 
Several members of the old council were called upon , but declined to speak . 
The meeting then adjourned .

FEROCITY OF THE FILIPINOS 
Massacre and Rapine Marked the Course of Their Biggest Warship Until It Fell Foul of a Typhoon . 
MANILA , July 2 . 
— This Island of Luzon is so large , the country is so hilly , and at this rainy season of the year the roads are so very bad that , in spite of the fact that communication is carried on with remarkable rapidity , considering the primitive methods employed , news really travels slowly and frequently gets mired in the deep muds or extinguished by the tropical downpour long before its destination is reached . 
There are only telegraph lines for short distances , and but one railroad line , and that in the southwestern section of the island , from Manila to Lingayeu Bay , a distance of 100 miles as the crow flies , but as the snake crawls it is about double that distance . 
We hold thirty or forty miles of the line outside Manila , and the terminus at Lingayen is guarded by the battleship Oregon . 
As the intermediate space is controlled by the insurgents no reliable information can beg depended upon by this means . 
This leaves the remaining 150 miles to the extreme northern end of Luzon in utter darkness as far as what is happening about Manila is concerned . 
Still , after remaining some little time at anchor in Manila Bay , where everything now seems to be devoted to peaceful pursuits , it is always more or less of a surprise , whenever any of the northern inhabitants are encountered , to find them so very bitter and warlike . 
This may be due to what happened when the Spaniards were in control , and the extortions and hardships carried on against the natives have left scars that will require two or three generations of fair dealing and kind treatment to remove . 
The Spanish Government was accustomed to bestow large tracts of land upon its grandees as rewards or favors , and these properties were worked for all they were worth the result being immense revenues . 
At the northern part of the island proper is grown the very best tobacco used in the cigar factories of Manila , while on the outlying islands is found the finest grazing lands in the Philippines . 
Cattle raised here are noted for the greater weight and finer flavor of the meat than can be found elsewhere in these latitudes . 
Consequently the prices commanded in the Manila markets , where everything is centred , are far and away above what are reached by the products of other sections . 
Attempts were often made to improve nature 's landscape gardening ; and very successful efforts they were . 
Probably the finest residences in the islands are in the northern portion . 
One sees houses that cost over $ 20,000 , and in one instance twice that sum must have been paid for a most tasteful modern dwelling . 
After the autumnal spell of bad weather is over hardly any climate could be finer from November to March than that which one can enjoy away up in the Northern Philippines . 
Just at this time , the season of the southwest monsoon , about the first thing to be sought for by small craft intending to make more or less of a stay " among the ports and islands to the northward is a place having good holding ground for the anchors and sufficient protection against the fierce winds accompanying the typhoons . 
The other day the Princeton , Commander Clifford H. West commanding , with her tender , the Pampanga , Ensign L. McNamee commanding , were cruising up north to see that there was no commerce and no smuggling being carried on . 
As the tender is rather a small craft in which to meet stormy winds a search for a harbor of refuge was among the first things to be undertaken . 
In going within Mauser rifle range of shore in the steam launch to take soundings and find a proper anchorage a sharp fusillade was opened . 
As the bullets were whistling about the launch , in which Commander West himself had embarked in order , as he says , not to order anybody into danger to which he would not expose himself , some of them struck her , and signal was made to the ship and her consort to open fire . 
The use of smokeless powder made it difficult to tell just where the bullets were coming from until , hidden partially by the woods-entrenchments were descried with an occasional insurgent 's head bobbing up behind them . 
A brisk fire drove the enemy out and admitted the withdrawal of the steam launch before anybody was hit . 
The following day an attempt to take soundings was again made , but numbers of Filipinos had flocked to the defense of the place , and in spite of our heavy guns the defenders fired away so rapidly that it was not deemed prudent to further expose the men , enough soundings having been taken for the purpose for which the survey was undertaken . 
The idea all along the coast was that our vessels were there to pillage and destroy , and that the homes must at all hazards be defended . 
At present they are not aware how gladly would we have them use their bolos for plowshares and go ahead with their tobacco and hemp culture . 
The present Harbor Master of the Port of Aparri , who is still numbered among the insurgents , bore a very conspicuous part in the earlier days of the troubles here in which we took a hand . 
The atrocities committed in those days show very clearly the fierce , revengeful spirit of the native , and how little he cares for the quieter , more peaceful life of civilization as we understand it . 
A steamer was seized by the insurgents at the time our troubles broke out with Spain , and early in Admiral Dewey 's time here this vessel came two or three times for coal . 
Her battery was obtained from the wreck of a man-of-war that was caught by a typhoon in an Insufficiently protected anchorage in one of the northern islands , and literally twisted and torn apart on a neighboring reef . 
Another gun from this wreck was the one recently captured by the navy at Cavite Bay , so she has really played her part in the drama . 
The insurgents and their steamer went cruising about , and wherever they could wreak vengeance on the Spaniards they proceeded to do so with a fierceness and cruelty reminding one forcibly of what our Indians used to do when on the warpath . 
The full weight of their wrath fell upon the inhabitants of the Spanish town of Santo Domingo , on the Island of Batan , one of a group of small islands between Luzon and Formosa . 
They landed their full force , and put every man they could find to the sword or shot him with their revolvers . 
Not content with this they gave a dance that same evening in the largest of the buildings and insisted that all the bereaved women should be present . 
This was followed by other violence , a natural sequence to murder and drunkenness ; and then the steamer left to descend upon some other equally defenseless place . 
She came here once only after our troubles with the insurgents began , clearing out as soon as she found that she was getting into hot waters . 
On a subsequent trip to the north she , too , met with a terrible storm and sought shelter in Aparri , where she was partly dismantled and taken sixteen miles up the river . 
Now volunteers are rising on every hand to go up there and capture her as she is the largest craft , the insurgents have . 
A cutting-out expedition , made up of two or three armored tugs , would be the only way to get at her but even that would be hazardous passing by banks lined with men armed with the Mauser . 
Just what will be done has not yet been decided ; but as the steamer is so far up the river and not in good repair she can do very little in the way of smuggling in arms and munitions of war .

Laborers Strike in Rotterdam 
Military Ordered Out to Preserve the Peace 
Rotterdam , May 16 
Six thousand dock laborers in this city have gone on strike because of a reduction in their wages , and four battalions of the National Guard have been called out as a precaution against any riotous demonstrations on the part of the strikers . 
Three gunboats are also lying opposite the city in readiness for action should their services be required to protect the shipping . 
Mr. Joseph Havelock Wilson , member of the British House of Commons for Middleborough , who is now in Rotterdam , escorted by a detachment of soldiers , had an interview with the Mayor and Chief of Police this morning . 
The seamen on board the British vessels lying at this port last evening resolved that they would refuse to comply with the demand they perform the work of the strikers in loading and discharging cargo , and the consequence is that fifty steamers are detained here .

Laundry Car over Cliff 
Laundry strike sympathizers drove a Walker Laundry Company motor truck over Cliff Drive hill at Hardesty Avenue late this afternoon , after capturing the car and routing the driver and two special officers at Fourteenth Street and Euclid Avenue . 
One of the special officers fired a shot into the crowd before fleeing from the rain of bricks and stones . 
No one was injured . 
Homer Maze , 5106 East Twenty-fourth Street , was driving the laundry truck . 
Guarding him were two special officers , Sam Seaman , 2700 East Twenty-seventh Street , and C.L. Winner , 717 East Eleventh Street . 
Maze was making a delivery at Fourteenth street and Euclid Avenue when a crowd of about twenty-five man and women approached from the west and opened fire of rocks and stones on the standing car . 
Maze came from the house and made a run to join the special officers . 
After several minutes of fusillading stones , the officers and Maze deserted the car and reported the disturbance at the Flora Avenue Police Station . 
Seaman , one of the special officers , told of firing a shot toward the crowd , attempting to disperse the strike sympathizers . 
Re-enforcements joining the attacking party seemed to arrive steadily , they said , so they gave up the car to the crowd . 
When the police arrived at the scene of the disturbance a part of the crowd was yet there . 
Six men and one woman were arrested . 
The men could not be identified by Maze or the special officers as having thrown stones . 
The woman , Julia Anderson , 1711 We st Prospect Place , was identified by them and was held on a $ 51 cash bond . 
She denies having thrown anything . 
The truck was found after a search , but is practically demolished . 
A second `` wrecking party was reported from Eleventh Street and Chestnut Avenue . 
B. L. Ferguson , 6424 Lee Street , driver of a Kansas City Laundry Company truck , and a special officer , Salvator Schira , 1911 Missouri Avenue , were attacked by fifteen men and twelve women . 
A stone thrown by one of the striking laundry workers struck Ferguson on the cheek , another on the right hand . 
His injuries are not severe .

LONDON ATTACKED AGAIN BY AIRMEN ; 20 MORE WOUNDED 
LONDON , Sept. 25 . 
Another hostile airplane raid on London was made tonight . 
There were two attacks apparently , for after forty minutes ’ quiet interval anti-aircraft guns resumed firing in the London district . 
In the first attack , after brisk firing by the defensive guns , lasting only ten minutes , the raiders were driven off without succeeding in reaching the city of London . 
The firing of the anti-aircraft guns in the second attack was of only brief duration . 
The raiders were finally driven off and the police gave out the “ all clear ” signal at 9:30 o’clock . 
A report of the raid was issued by Field Marshal French as follows : 
The Thames estuary was again the objective of a hostile air raid this evening . 
The Kent and Essex coast was crossed at various points and a few bombs were dropped , but no casualties are yet reported . 
One raider penetrated as far as the southeastern outskirts of London , where two bombs fell , causing some twenty casualties . 
The weather conditions were favorable for the raiders , but judging from the information thus far available , tonight ’s raid was less serious than Monday night ’s , and apparently the raiders were less numerous . 
There was a general expectation of another visit and many business houses and stores closed down earlier than usual to enable the employes to reach their homes safely before the raiders arrived . 
As a result when the police warnings to take cover were given , the streets in the city section were rapidly cleared , although much omnibus traffic continued throughout the raid . 
Large crowds had been waiting at most tube stations in expectation of the raid and immediately took refuge underground . 
Result of Monday ’s Raid . 
Fifteen persons were killed and seventy injured in last night ’s air raid over London . 
The following official report was given out by Lord French , commander of the home defenses : 
Airplane Raid . 
— The latest reports concerning last night ’s airplane raid show that the group of raiders which approached London was driven off by the fire of anti-aircraft guns . 
Only one or at the most two machines penetrated the defenses . 
The casualties in all the raided districts , reported by the police up to the present , are : Killed , 15 ; Injured , 70 . 
The material damage was not great . 
Airship Raid . 
— Enemy airships crossed the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire coasts between midnight and 3 A. M . 
There is no evidence of their having penetrated to any distance inland . 
They were driven off by gunfire from various defended localities which they attempted to approach . 
Bombs were dropped at one coast town , three women being slightly injured . 
Little material damage was caused . 
Three Killed in Kent . 
Reports from a Kent coast town say that the raid there lasted for about half an hour , and eight bombs were dropped . 
Three persons were killed and five injured , while considerable damage was done to property , mostly in the residential district , where the casualties occurred . 
A large Nonconformist chapel was struck and the roof fell into the interior of the building . 
The raiders — evidently Gothas , from the sound of the engines — were heavily fired at by anti-aircraft batteries and attacked by British airplanes . 
Viewed by daylight this morning , the damage resulting from the visit of the German raiders to London appeared to be surprisingly slight . 
The number of bombs dropped in the London district was small , and the practical results were almost negligible . 
The chief damage visible this morning was broken glass . 
In one spot , where a heavy bomb landed squarely in the middle of the street , a hole four feet deep was torn in the pavement . 
The spot was fenced off early in the morning , and men were at work repairing the pavement . 
The concussion of this bomb broke glass over several acres , including windows in neighboring hotels , in which were many Americans , Canadians , and Australians . 
Only three persons were killed by this explosion . 
All of them were standing in a doorway watching the explosion of shrapnel overhead . 
In this district about half a dozen persons were wounded , mostly by breaking glass . 
Wagonloads of glass were swept up from the pavements and carried away early in the morning . 
Fierce Battle with Raiders . 
It appears that the fierce battle which the british airplanes and anti-aircraft artillery put up forced the raiders to leave London without dropping any considerable part of their cargo of explosives . 
One of the London districts received several bombs with rather less important results than on the occasion of previous visits of the raiders . 
Two bombs fell in the Thames , near the bridge , throwing a column of water so high that it splashed clear over the walls . 
The enemy remained over London , at a great height , for the greater part of two hours and the raid appears to have been on a pretentious scale , but it was even more abortive than previous attempts . 
Although the visitors arrived early in the evening , Londoners have taken to heart the advice of the authorities about seeking cover , and this accounts in part for the small number of casualties . 
It is safe to say , however , that at least three-fourths and probably four-fifths of the casualties were suffered by persons who had failed to take cover or persisted out of curiosity in watching the overhead spectacle from the inadequate shelter of balconies or doorways . 
A suburban county official named Lapwood dropped dead from excitement . 
Flee From American Eagle Hut . 
There were nearly a hundred persons in the American Eagle hut on the Strand when the warning was given . 
These included about a score of American women volunteer workers . 
The usual routine in the case of an air raid was carried through without a hitch , everybody being sent to shelter in the cellars and ground floors of nearby business buildings , and the hut was locked up . 
It was supposed that every one had heeded the warning and left the hut , but a soldier , who was sleeping in the dormitory , was left behind , having rolled over for another half minute ’s snooze after the warnings had been given . 
He was reawakened suddenly in the darkened hut by a piece of shrapnel from the British barrage coming suddenly through the roof near his bed . 
Finally he escaped by a window and hurried to a place of shelter . 
The Daily Mail , in an editorial commenting on last night ’s air raid , calls for reprisals , saying : 
“ The British people would view these attacks with entire indifference if they knew that every one of them was followed by an attack in which twice the weight of bombs dropped here was showered on German towns . 
Let ’s hit the Germans ; hit them hard . ” 
April 25 , 1907 
Mark Twain here with H. H. Rogers 
A luxurious mahogany tender bearing the name Kanawha lay wallowing in the slip adjoining the Norfolk-Portsmouth ferry pier this afternoon . 
Off shore lay a great white steam yacht , while o the pier an inquisitive person connected with the local newspaper sought to pump out of the head man on the yacht tender whether Norfolk 's greatest benefactor Henry H. Rogers , was aboard his yacht or to the best of his knowledge and belief ever had been aboard and failed completely . 
Then a figure in ghostly garb , which recently with rare humor announced that it had just rounded " pier 70 , " and did all its work of illuminating the world in bed , came down the pier from the connected end and the inquisite person instantly concluded , it seems , that it was the head of the Standard Oil Company . 
It was escorted by Walter H. Taylor , attorney for the Virginian railway company , and H. P. Reigart , purchasing agent for the same road , formerly the Tidewater-Deepwater . 
Its locks were white as the fleece of that Angora goat from the raising of which more profit is derived by amateurs than is from raising chickens , and it was clothed in a sort of light grey cloth of almost an ice cream hue . 
Mark Twain ; Not Rogers 
This distinguished figure was introduced to the inquisite person as Mr. Rogers , but MR. Taylor gave proof that he has a conscience by explaining subsequently that it was Mr. Clemens . 
Then everybody did what all the world does when Mr. Clemens wills with words . 
They laughed . 
Mark Twain then told who was aboard the Kanawha , saying that Henry H. Rogers was brought along because he owns the yacht and pays the freight , that Mr. Rogers son , Henry H. Rogers , Jr. , Messrs. W. E. Benjamin and Urban Broughton , his sons-in-law , and Mr. Lancaster , an English gentleman , were along . 
He said that all the others went out on the Tidewater this morning to inspect the line and that the party will stay here over tomorrow , at least , to see the ceremonies incident to opening the Jamestown Exposition . 
He said he had no impressions fit for publication and immediately afterward said that the fleet in Hampton Roads this morning was a pretty sight . 
Speed of Sound . 
Then he started to tell , in a story which stretched from the ferry landing almost to the Monticello Hotel , sometimes taking long strides and occasionally halting , how he counted the guns which were fired from our warships this morning when the British and Austrian squadrons came in from sea ; that he counted eight between the flash of fire and the sound which reached the Kanawha and estimated that the firing ships were eight-elevenths of a mile away . 
At intervals afterward , while his brain was chewing away upon this problem and his lips occasionally expressed aloud the fear that the brain was not telling the truth , and the wish that he could have a look into the encyclopedia in order to verify the impression gained therefrom some thirty years ago the only one made side remarks . 
Then he , and Messrs. Taylor and Reigard , his entertainers , sailed for the exposition grounds in an automobile . 
As the infernal machine made the preliminary thundering noise preparatory to starting he shouted that all he wanted to know was how far sound travels in a second ; that he thought then it was 1,100 feet and his seconds in the opening chapter of this story were much too short .

MEETING OF REDS TRAPS SLACKERS 
U.S. Marshal Arrests Thirty at ' Protest Against Draft ' Without Registration Cards . 
WARNS AGAINST DISLOYALTY 
" I Will Arrest This Goldman Woman , " He Says , " if She Organizes More Such Meetings . " 
Leon Samson , a pale-faced Columbia University Student , who when asked if he had a registration card replied meekly : " I am only 20 years old , " and Emma Goldman , the anarchist agitator , staged a mass meeting which they styled a " protest against the selective draft law by the Collegiate League for Peace and Harmony , " at 10 West 114th Street last night , and by so doing made it possible for United States Marshal Thomas D. McCarthy to round up a number of men of conscript age who had defied the law by refusing to register last Tuesday . 
The round-up came at the end of the meeting and took the anarchists and their youthful dupes , among them a score of girls still in their teens , entirely by surprise . 
The result was a wild scramble for the exits , but at every door stood one or two policemen and several National Guardsmen . 
Every man who was of draft age had to show his card and those that could not were taken into custody . 
In all thirty men were detained pending an investigation of their status by the proper Federal authorities . 
At midnight two had confessed that they had willfully disobeyed the law and were ordered locked up . 
The other twenty-eight , who during the meeting had shouted and applauded when President Wilson was sneered at , the Liberty Loan denounced , and the army and navy referred to in jeering terms , were meek as lambs and pitifully begged for permission to go home . 
Some said they had left their cards at home , others said they had lost them , while still others insisted that they had given them to relatives for safe keeping . 
Seventeen were finally let go , but eleven were detained until their cards are produced . 
" We are sick and tired of these disloyal meetings in New York , " said Marshal McCarthy as he surveyed the line of frightened men lined up in single file against the wall in the hall where the meetings at which all things American were denounced was held . 
" And , furthermore , " the Marshal added , " I want it clearly understood that in the future we are not going to permit these unpatriotic and disloyal gatherings . 
We ca n't stop free speech as contemplated by the Constitution , but we can put an end to disloyalty , and we are going to do it . 
" We would have been entirely justified in arresting every man who attended this meeting , and they can be thankful that we did not . 
The United States is at war , and the people who attend and applaud anti-American utterances are not good Americans . 
They are not friends of the United States . 
I have informed this Goldman woman that in the future we will not permit her to organize such meetings . 
If she does she will be arrested if I have to do it myself . 
This goes for all of her kind , too . " 
Hates " the American Kaiser . " 
The meeting place was a small hall on the second floor of Lenox Hall on 114th Street , near Lenox Avenue . 
Some other organization had used the hall for a meeting Sunday night , and those who attended happened to be of the kind who think the United States is a pretty good country and is worth fighting for , and they had put some American flags on the wall . 
The result was that the meeting was held under the Stars and Stripes , a fact that proved a matter of chagrin to those who applauded like wild Indians when Samson shouted that " as much as we hate the German Kaiser , we hate still more the American Kaiser . " 
Everybody present realized whom he had in mind . 
As was the case at the anarchist gathering in the Bronx , a week ago the police were prepared to handle any sort of a demonstration last night . 
The four little searchlight automobiles were on hand early . 
Two hundred uniformed men were in reserve nearby , while an equal number were scattered in and about the hall . 
The police lines were established a block on either side of the meeting place and inside those lines only authorized persons were permitted to go . 
The hall will hold 1,000 persons when crowded , but the police did not permit more than 500 to enter . 
At 8 o'clock Samson , who was then defiant of attitude and utterance , arose to open the meeting . 
On one side of him sat a young man named Rabinovich , who said he represented the College of the City of New York . 
Charles Francis Phillips , the former Columbia student , who goes on trial tomorrow for conspiracy to dissuade men from registering , was listed among the speakers , but Phillips , who has had a change of heart , did not appear . 
Owen Cattell , son of Professor Cattell of Columbia , under indictment with Phillips , showed up , however , but he took the advice of the police and negotiated a speedy exit . 
Miss Grace Grumbecker of Hunter College was also scheduled for a speech , but she was not there or she did not make her presence known . 
Daniel Cooper of Harvard , the other speaker , also failed to make his scheduled utterance . 
Samson , in his opening harangue , devoted much of his time to the Workmen 's and Soldiers ' Council of Russia . 
He announced that he was about to organize such a council to run things in the United States , and when he said that the young girls and the young men of conscript age applauded for a full minute . 
He said the time had come when " we are going to refuse to stand up and shoot down our brothers . " 
The war , he declared , with great solemnity , is " a dollar war , " and he reached his climax by prophesying a draft riot which , he added , would be more than a riot . 
" It 's going to be a draft revolution , " he said . 
It was about this time that he mentioned the " American Kaiser . " 
He was careful not to mention President Wilson by name . 
After him came Emma Goldman , who was so excited that her face looked like a prize red poppy at a flower show . 
She denounced everything in sight . 
She said the anarchists now on trial for conspiracy to defeat the purposes of the draft law are being rushed to prison " by perjured testimony . " 
The Home Guard she dubbed " a lot of parasites and police scabs . " 
The State is taking a census , she added , to draft men into the militia to shoot down the laboring men . 
When the Goldman woman stopped speaking , as much from exhaustion as anything else , young Samson stood up and started a plea for funds . 
A tall , square shouldered man then walked down the aisle . 
He was Lieutenant Barnitz of the New York police force , who has devoted all of his time since the war started to running down and arresting persons who think more of Germany than the United States . 
Barnitz motioned Samson to stop speaking . 
" How old are you ? " demanded Barnitz . 
The young man 's face turned as white as a newly laundered sheet . 
" Twenty , only twenty , " he murmured in a voice so low that only Barnitz heard it . 
Barnitz returned to the rear of the hall and had a conference with Marshal McCarthy , Assistant United States District Attorney Harold A. Content , and Inspector Ryan of the police . 
" I do n't know of a better place than this to begin the roundup of slackers , " said Marshal McCarthy , as he looked about the room . 
Samson in the meantime was making a heroic effort to resume speaking , but he was very nervous , and his words were uttered with difficulty . 
Men turned in their seats and looked at the Federal officials in conference . 
Two or three started to leave . 
" Return to your seats , " said a policeman at the door . 
" I want to go home , I promised my wife I would be back at 9:30 o'clock , " one of the men said . 
" Well , maybe you can telephone her that you are detained , " the policeman answered , and the men sheepishly returned to their seats . 
" The meeting 's over , " shouted Samson suddenly and the crowd started for the exits . 
" Women and girls may go , but all men of conscript age must show their registration cards , " Marshal McCarthy announced . 
A young fellow tried to edge himself out between two girls . 
A guardsman pulled him back . 
" Where 's your card ? " the guardsmen asked . 
" I have n't got it now , my mother 's keeping it for me , " the frightened man answered . 
He was escorted to a deserted corner of the room . 
More than 100 men were in that corner by the time the room had been cleared . 
Just one woman remained . 
Emma Goldman . 
Marshal McCarthy ordered her put out . 
She shouted her defiance , but policemen got behind her and gave her a push . 
A guardsman gave her another and she went out at express speed . 
Then began the census of the prisoners . 
Samson was among those detained . 
He is said to have admitted being in doubt as to how old he is , but the police mean to be sure about it . 
Herman Woskow , 21 years old , of 128 Second Avenue , said he was born in Russia , and had taken out citizen papers , but added that he had no intention of registering . 
He will be arraigned in the Federal Building this morning . 
Philip Levine , 22[?] years old , of 79 Division Street , also admitted he had not registered and said he had no intention of doing so . 
He will be arraigned with Woskow . 
Hyman Bessner of 1,062 Southern Boulevard , had a card unlike any other seen by Marshal McCarthy . 
He said he received it from the official registrar last Tuesday , and is held while his story is investigated . 
The anarchists announced last night that they will hold a mass meeting in Madison Square Saturday afternoon at 2 o'clock . 
There is reason to believe that the meeting will not take place . 
September 23 , 1893 
MORE FRENCH WORKMEN ARRIVE . 
They Come to Study the Fair and Are Met by " Tommy " Morgan . 
The second delegation of French workmen to the Fair arrived over the Nickel Plate last night . 
Local labor men were represented by Thomas Morgan and James Linchan , who took charge of the party . 
The object of the visit is to study the Fair and the methods of American workmen . 
These Paris delegates are thirty-five in number and each wears a bow of tricolored ribbon in his buttonhole . 
Each is supplied with $ 606 by the municipality of Paris for expenses during the few weeks ' stay . 
M. Laroche is the Secretary and M. Legrand the Treasurer . 
Laroche is a photographer and Legrand an actor .

NEW LYON KING OF ARMS 
The King has been pleased , on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for Scotland , to approve of the appointment of Captain George Sitwell Campbell Swinton , at present Albany Herald to be Lyon King of Arms in Scotland and Secretary to the Order of the Thistle in succession to Sir James Balfour Paul , K.C.V.O. , LL.D. , whose resignation takes effect as from December 31 , 1926 . 
Sir James Balfour Paul , who will be 80 next November , has been Lyon King since 1890 . 
The great improvement in Scottish heraldic art is due largely to his wise encouragement of Mr. Grahame Johnston , the Herald Painter to his Court , Mr. Law Samson. , and other artists in according to the armorial designs issued by the Lyon Office a vigour of treatment reminiscent of the best period of heraldry . 
He is deeply learned and scholarly antiquary , as his published works prove . 
Captain Swinton , formerly March Pursuivant of Arms , has been Albany Herald since 1923 , and is well qualified for the difficult task of succeeding Sir James Balfour Paul . 
He has served a long time on the L.C.C. , was chairman of the Town Planning Committee of the new Delhi , and was hon. secretary of the Scottish National War Memorial Committee in 1918 . 
December 11 , 1883 . 
NO LONGER AN EDITOR . 
“ Yes , that is true , ” said the Hon. Carl Schurz last evening , after reading the announcement in the Evening Post that he had permanently dissolved his connection with that paper “ in consequence of serious differences of opinion between himself and his associates concerning the treatment of important public questions in the editorial columns . ” 
“ Do you feel at liberty to state the nature of the differences that arose between your associates and yourself ? ” asked the reporter . 
“ It was in the matter of the relations between corporations and their employes and kindred questions , ” answered Mr. Schurz , “ things that I regard as of constantly increasing importance . 
At the time of the strike of the telegraph operators last Summer , it may have been noticed by the readers of the Evening Post that there were two different currents of opinion in the editorial columns on the general subject . 
After I had gone on my Summer vacation , about Aug. 1 , some articles appeared involving doctrines against which I protested , and for which I informed my associate in charge that I could not take any responsibility . 
I have since then withheld myself from taking part in the editorial conduct of the paper . ” 
Mr. Schurz was not prepared to say anything regarding his future course of action . 
He was asked if it was true that Attorney-General Brewster had instructed the United States District Attorney to appear for him ( Mr. Schurz ) in the suit brought against him by Charles D. Gilmore for $ 300,000 damages . 
Mr. Gilmore was disbarred by Mr. Schurz when the latter was Secretary of the Interior . 
“ I was informed the day before yesterday , ” said the ex-Secretary , “ that the District Attorney had received directions to appear for me . 
The questions involve the power of the heads of departments to regulate the appearance of counsel in those departments and to disbar them for good cause ; and no Secretary can keep his department clear of illegitimate practices if he is obliged to permit everybody to transact business there as an attorney , no matter what tricks the attorney may resort to . ” 
“ For what reason did you disbar Mr. Gilmore ? ” 
“ The records of the Department of the Interior will show that it was a simple performance of duty on my part to do so . 
Perhaps the particulars might be obtained there . 
I disbarred scores of attorneys during the four years of my term as Secretary . 
Pension attorneys and others were disbarred for malpractice ; and it would be an impossibility for anybody to take charge of a department if all such disbarred attorneys could come and receive damages from him . 
I suppose , therefore , that this case is of considerable interest to the present Secretary of the Interior in his wrestle with the pension attorneys . 
Mr. Gilmore had a large practice , was supposed to be wealthy , and is a sort of representative man among them . ”

Obituary : Mrs. Andrew Crosse , née Berkeley 
A wide circle of scientific and literary friends will regret to learn that Mrs. Andrew Crosse died from syncope , resulting from influenza , on Saturday afternoon last , at the age of 68 . 
She was the widow of Andrew Crosse , the celebrated electrician , who would , were he alive now be in 111th year . 
In July , 1850 , Mr. Crosse , already an elderly man , married Miss Cornelia A. H. Berkeley , then a great beauty , and in her 23rd year . 
Five years later Mr. Crosse died , leaving a widow , with three little children . 
Mrs. Cross left Fyne Court , on the Quantock Hills , where her husband had been squire , and where his experiments had made him the legend of the neighbourhood , and resided at Comeytrowe-house , near Taunton . 
Encourage by Sir Roderick Murchison , she published , in 1857 , the " Memorials of Andrew Crosse , " a charming volume , full of graceful and vivacious reminiscences . 
The success of this biography did not tempt her , however , to very serious literary work until lately . 
She moved in all the best scientific society , wrote occasionally , and devoted herself to the education of her sons . 
For the last 30 years she had received a multitude of friends at her house in Delamere-terrace . 
Of late she has been persuaded by Mr. Bentley to contribute to Temple Bar articles on the distinguished friends with whom she had in earlier days been intimate — Faraday , Babbage , Walter Savage Landor , Robert and Elizabeth Browning , Kenyon and Kinglake , and others . 
These were collected into two volumes , in 1892 , under the title of " Red-letter Days of my Life , " and achieved a great success . 
Up to within a few weeks of her death , Mrs. Crosse was engaged on a second series of scientific reminiscences , which , it is hoped , were far enough carried to be bear publication . 
She was a women of remarkable social charm and sympathetic intelligence , knew a good story when she met with one , and could repeat it , either in conversation or in writing , with excellent effect . 1924 
Obituary : Miss Gordon-Cumming 
Miss C. F. Gordon-Cumming , whose death is announced elsewhere , was one of the most travelled ladies of the last century . 
Although she was in no sense an explorer , still the narratives of her widespread travels , written with humour and intelligent observation , did much to diffuse among the general reading public a knowledge of countries of which most people were fairly ignorant . 
In 1904 she published her " Autobiography , " which is full of interest . 
She had very fair artistic taste and produced , as the result of her wide wanderings , many sketches , both in black-and-white and in colour , which she was always ready to exhibit whenever desired to do so . 
She was a woman of great vigour , both of body and of mind , and was always a welcome companion to her many friends and acquaintances . 
Constance Frederica Gordon-Cumming was born at Altyre , in Morayshire , on May 24 , 1837 , the twelfth of the 15 children of Sir William Gordon-Cumming , second baronet , and head of the Clan Cumming , or Comyn . 
The Comyns played a great part in the early days of Scottish history , and Miss Gordon-Cumming was proud of her ancestry , which she traced back to Charlemagne . 
By inter-marriage they were related to many of the leading Scottish families and not a few of those of England . 
Miss Gordon-Cumming tells us she " started in life with 50 first cousins , about twice as many second and third cousins , and collaterals without number , for the family tree had roots and brahces ramifying in every direction ; and as each group centred round some more or less notable house it followed that England and Scotland were dotted over with points of family interest in those good old days when it was held that ' blood is thicker than water , ' and kinship , however much diluted , was freely recognized . " 
She spent her early years at Altyre amid beautiful and happy surroundings . 
Her brother , Roualeyn Gordon-Cumming , the celebrated South African lion-hunter , was 17 years older than his sister , and his return when she was six years old was a great event . 
Other brothers made their way to India , Ceylon , and other parts of the world . 
so that she may be said to have been brought up in an atmosphere of travel and adventure . 
At the age of six " Eka " as she was called , went to live at Cresswell Hall , Northumberland , with her eldest sister , who had married Oswald Baker Cresswell , From here she was sent to school in London , where at intervals she spent several years . 
After the death of her father in 1854 , Miss Gordon-Cumming lived with relatives in Northumberland , London , the Highlands , and elsewhere . 
Thus she passed her life until in 1868 at the age of 31 , she mad , with much hesitation , her first venture in foreign travel by paying a visit to her sister , who had married an officer stationed in India . 
She took ample advantage of her opportunities to visit much that was worth seeing in India , including the Himalayas . 
Here she had what she called a " a year of enchantment . " 
On her return she recorded her experiences and impressions in her first publication , " From the Hebrides to the Himalayas , " a bulky work , afterwards divided into two — " In the Hebrides and " In the Himalayas and on Indian Plains . " 
On her visit to India , she was able to get a glimpse of the attractions of Ceylon . 
Her desire to see more of the island was gratified in 1872 when on the invitation of her old friends she visited the island and the results were published in her " Two Happy Years in Ceylon . " 
Miss Gordin-Cumming made no pretensions to be an explorer , like Mrs Bishop ( Miss Isabella Bird ) and other adventurous ladies of the 19th and 20th centuries . 
But the first two records of her travels show her to have been a keen observer , interested in man of the aspects of the regions she traversed — in the geography , their geology , their people , and their works , their beliefs , superstitions , and folk-lore , in social and political conditions — so that her narratives , full of brightness and humour and human sympathy , were for the time substantial contributions to knowledge . 
She had been home only for a few months when she had the opportunity of visiting Fiji , which had been handed over by the chiefs to the Great White Queen . 
In March , 1875 , she accompanied the first Governor , Sir Arthur Hamilton Gordon ( the first Lord Stanmore ) , and his party . 
En route she spent some weeks at Sydney , arriving at Fiji in September . 
Here she spent the next two years , of which " every day was full of interest and novelty , " as recorded in her narrative " At Home in Fiji , " including her experiences of a visit to new Zealand . 
It was in 1877 , while in Fiji , that she was offered the opportunity of a voyage in the Pacific in a French man-of-war , visiting Tahiti , Tonga , Samoa , and other groups , finishing up in California . 
The result was one of her most interesting narratives , " A Lady 's Cruise in a French Man-of-War . " 
Her sis months in California furnisher her with material for her " Granite Crags of California . " 
In August , 1878 , she left San Francisco for Japan , where she spent several months , the only account of which is contained in her " Memories ( 1904 ) , occupying five chapters full of interest on many aspects of Japanese life . 
From Japan she passed on to China , to which she devoted six months , the story of which is told in her " Wanderings in China . " 
In September 1879 , she returned to San Francisco with General Ulysses Grant and his family . 
From San Francisco she visited the Hawaiian Islands , where , among her other experiences , she climbed the great volcano Mauna Loa , many aspects of which she recorded in those sketches which formed some of the most attractive and instructive results of her worldwide travels . 
Altogether what Miss Gordon-Cumming accomplished in those years of almost incessant travel is remarkable and her voluminous records of the results not only in books but in dozens of magazine articles , are far above the flimsy narratives of the mere globetrotter . 
On her return she took up her residence at Crieff , and there she remained for the rest of her life , devoting herself to her neighbours , rich and poor , and th her numerous relations . 
She also spent much time in developing the invention of the numeral type for the use of illiterate Chinese , both blind and seeing .

" PACIFISTS " GET FRIGHT OF LIVES AT CAPITOL AGED SENATOR LODGE WALLOPS ONE FOR COUNT 
WASHINGTON , April 2 . 
Pacifists who came to Washington by the thousands today under the guidance of the Emergency Peace Federation to protest to congress against war had a turbulent time . 
The capital , bedecked with the national colors and overflowing with patriotic enthusiasm , gave the peace advocates anything but a cordial reception . 
On the streets , the white arm bands and " we want peace " streamers of the visitors drew frequent jeers . 
At the capitol " patriotic pilgrims " from various cities went over the same course as the pacifists , urging members of congress to uphold the hands of the President and the honor of the nation . 
There were numerous disorders , the most sensational incident of the day taking place in the office of Senator Lodge . 
The senator was called to the door to hear the arguments of the visitors . 
There were harsh words and then blows were exchanged between the senator , aged 67 and Alexander Bannwart , of Rochester , Mass. , born in Switzerland of Swiss-German parents . 
Senator Lodge sent his antagonist to the floor with a blow to the jaw , and while the officer force was clearing away the other pacifists a young man in the corridor pummelled Bannwart vigorously before turning him over at the hands of David B. Herman , a half grown telegraph messenger . 
Then the capitol police appeared and Bannwart , very bloody , was locked up charged with assault . 
Later he was released on $ 1,000 cash bail for his appearance in police court tomorrow morning . 
Bannwart for some time has been a promoter and secretary of the Woodrow Wilson Independent League of Massachusetts . 
He was graduated from Princeton University in 1906 . 
Excitement over the fight in the Capitol had just subsided when a thousand of the peace champions , wearing white arm bands and banners bearing such inscriptions as " Keep Out of War , " and " We Want Peace , " began to assemble on the east entrance steps of the capitol for a demonstration . 
It was remarked that foreign accents were frequently to be heard and sentences in German were spoken more than once . 
The police started to clear the broad steps before the demonstration was fairly begun . 
They had some difficulty and the reserves were sent for in a hurry . 
Then the Pacifists were pressed back to the edge of the plaza , the police forming lines to keep them there . 
About this time " Pilgrims of Patriotism " and other anti-Pacifists made their appearance . 
Heated arguments started immediately and at least two fist fights were launched . 
The belligerents were very quickly then the anti-Pacifists grouped themselves about the crowd and jeered and hooted . 
They applauded the police every time one o the Pacifists was required to go back of the lines . 
After an hour the Uacifists assembled at Convention hall for a business meeting . 
The convention hall adjoins a national guard armory , and guardsmen booed , hooted , jeered as the Pacifists passed . 
The police arrived in time to prevent hostilities . 
The meeting in the hall was interrupted by word that President Wilson was to address the congress shortly but the crowd made for the Capitol again . 
This time they let it be known that they were not going to demonstrate , so the police allowed them to stand on the steps at the house side . 
There they remained until it was announced that the President would not appear until 8 o'clock . 
Arrangements were made quickly for holding at once the mass meeting that had been scheduled for tonight , so the delegates congregated about the capitol when the President arrived . 
Speakers at the meeting urged the maintenance of peace . 
The plans of the Pacifists were so delayed that their mass meeting was not in progress until just before the President went to the Capitol . 
Several thousand persons gathered in the hall . 
Disorder threatened on several occasions , but the police , reinforced by armed national guardsmen managed to hold the jeering crowd in check . 
The meeting adopted a set of resolutions , protesting vigorously against war and urging the appointment of a joint high commission to settle the issues with Germany . 
Free For All 
A portion of the crowd discouraged at Concention hall by the police marched to the headquarters of the Emergency Peace Federation later in the night and adjourned after threatening to wreck the place if signs to banish them were not removed , started a free for all fight . 
It was stopped quickly by the police . 
As soon as the Pacifists began to arrive today they were sent to Capitol hill by their senators and told to see the senators and representatives from their home states . 
The Capitol and the house and senate official buildings literally swarmed with them for several hours . 
It was during this period that Bannwart and several associates called at the office of Senator Lodge . 
Pacifist Struck 
Senator Lodge , Senator Weeks and others who saw the encounter say Bannwart struck first at the conclusion of a volley of remarks in which he called the senator a " damned coward , " and the senator replied : 
" You are a liar . " 
Bannwart tonight denied emphatically that he had hit Senator Lodge first , saying : " I had no idea he was going to strike me . 
He just hauled off and hit me as hard as he could . 
Then a half dozen fellows had a fine time trying to finish me up . 
That messenger boy had an especially good time . 
I hope I do n't have to go to jail . 
Why , if I had hit Senator Lodge first I would not have a leg to stand on . " 
The Arizona man who attacked Bannwart after the latter 's fight with Senator Lodge was Ward Davis , and immigration field agent of the Casa Grande Chamber of Commerce . 
He was at the capitol to see congress convene and happened to be passing Senator Lodge 's office .

RETIREMENT OF SIR GEORGE MURRAY 
We understand that Sir George Murray , Permanent Secretary of the Treasury , is retiring in the course of the current month . 
Although Sir George has not reached the age of compulsory retirement , he has passed that at which retirement is optional . 
The Right Hon. Sir George Herbert Murray , G.C.B. , head of the Civil Service , retires at the age of 62 from the important and onerous post of Permanent Secretary of the Treasury . 
He is the grandson of Dr. Murray , the last Bishop of Sodor and Man appointed by his kinsman , the Duke of Atholl , Lord of Man . 
Sir George was in the first instance appointed a Clerk in the Foreign Office , but after a few years ' service in that Department he was transferred to a clerkship in Treasury . 
He was private secretary to Mr. Gladstone , when Prime Minister from 1892 to 1894 , and to Lord Rosebery from Mr. Gladstone 's retirement in 1894 to the fall of the Rosebery Ministry in 1895 . 
He was Chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue , 1897 to 1899 , Secretary of the Post Office , 1899 to 1903 , and Permanent Secretary of the Treasury from 1903 . 
He was given the Grand Cross of the Bath in 1908 , and was sworn of the Privy Council in 1910 . 
Sir George had a great knowledge of the traditions of the public service invaluable to the holder of his post , and he has enjoyed in a singular degree the confidence of the chiefs under whom he has served — a merited confidence , as he belonged to the old school of Civil servants which , while rendering to its chiefs hearty assistance , effaced its own personality . 
Sir George wisely lays down the heavy routine work of office while " it is yet day , " but he is young enough to render good service to the State . 
He goes out now to South Africa as Chairman of the Commission which is about to adjust relations between the various States of the Commonwealth .

" SEPTEMBER MORN " CONTINUOUS RIOT OF MUSIC AND DANCING 
Comedy At Orpheum Is One of Funniest Ever Staged Here ; Hilarious Performance Will Be Repeated Tonight . 
From the opening chorus to the grand finale , " Star Spangled Banner , " " September Morn , " the biggest fun festival with tunes and tangoes kept a big audience in a roar of laughter at the Orpheum theatre last night . 
There is just enough plot in " September Morn " to back up its name and prevent the show from resembling a cabaret program . 
But there are plenty of good congs , good singers and even better dancers , and altogether the show is one of the best that has come to Bisbee in many moons . 
Ruth Wilkins as " Argentina , the World 's Greatest Dancer , " and William Moore , as " Professor Plastric , " walked off the stage with most of the applause , although applause in great chunks was not lacking for anyo f the cast . 
Miss Wilkins ' dancing was graceful , rythmical and thoroughly enjoyable . 
Moore proved to be about the best " squirrel-food comedian " ever seen cavorting behind local footlights . 
Billy Murphy 's eccentric dancing was as clever as it was ridiculous , and that is saying a good deal , for his every movement resembled that of a lunatic suffering from St. Vitus dance and epileptic fits . 
The ballroom dances by Leslie Jones and Miss Wilkins were also unusually good . 
" September Morn " is just one long joyous riot of fun , music and dancing . 
There is not a week spot in the cast and if a better musical snow appears in Bisbee this season it will be a surprise to everyone who was at the Orpheum last night . 
" September Morn " will be repeated tonight . 
And — just a suggestion : It would not seem entirely out of the way , during this critical time , if the entire audience would remain standing during the singing of the " Star Spangled Banner , " at the close of the show , instead of breaking for the doors in a manner that would indicate that there is little respect for the national anthem in Bisbee .

Tesla 's New Device Like Bolts of Thor 
Nikola Tesla , the inventor , winner of the 1915 Nobel Physics Prize , has filed patent applications on the essential parts of a machine the possibilities of which test a layman 's imagination and promise a parallel of Thor 's shouting thunderbolts from the sky to punish those who had angered the gods . 
Dr. Tesla insists there is nothing sensational about it , that it is but the fruition of many years of work and study . 
He is not yet ready to give the details of the engine which he says will render fruitless any military expedition against a country which possesses it . 
Suffice to say that the destructive invention will go through space with a speed of 300 miles a second , a manless airship without propelling engine or wings , sent by electricity to any desired point on the globe on its errand of destruction , if destruction its manipulator wishes to effect . 
Ten miles or a thousand miles , it will be all the same to the machine , the inventor says . 
Straight to the point , on land or on sea , it will be able to go with precision , delivering a blow that will paralyze or kill , as is desired . 
A man in a tower on Long Island could shield New York against ships or army by working a lever , if the inventor 's anticipations become realizations . 
" It is not the time , " said Dr. Tesla yesterday , " to go into the details of this thing . 
It is founded on a principle that means great things in peace , it can be used for great things in war . 
But I repeat , this is no time to talk of such things . 
" It is perfectly practicable to transmit electrical energy without wires and produce destructive effects at a distance . 
I have already constructed a wireless transmitter which makes this possible , and have described it in my technical publications , among which I may refer to my patent 1,119,732 recently granted . 
With transmitters of this kind we are enabled to project electrical energy in any amount to any distance and apply it for innumerable purposes , both in peace and war . 
Through the universal adoption of this system , ideal conditions for the maintenance of law and order will be realized , for then the energy necessary to the enforcement of right and justice will be normally productive , yet potential , and in any moment available , for attack and defense . 
The power transmitted need not be necessarily destructive , for , if existence is made to depend upon it , its withdrawal or supply will bring about the same results as those now accomplished by force of arms . 
Dr. Tesla then said that it would be possible with his wireless mechanism to direct an ordinary aeroplane , manless , to any point over a ship or an army , and to discharge explosives of great strength from the base of operations . 
Asked to express an opinion upon the announcement last Sunday of Charles H. Harris , an electrical engineer of Los Angeles , that he would be able to surround this country with an electrical wall of fire in time of war , Dr. Tesla gave it as his opinion that Mr. Harris was not practical . ' 
" It is hard to stamp as impossible such results as those described in the press dispatches to which you refer . 
Granted , however , that the project is feasible , it would take more than all the motive power obtainable in the United States to throw a wall of fire around the country . 
In fact , even the passage of small currents at considerable distances through air consumes a great deal of energy on account of the immense pressure required . 
So , for instance , in lightning discharges , energy may be delivered at the rate of billions of horsepower , though the currents are of smaller volume than those developed by electrical generators in our power houses . "

THE CHESS MATCH 
Everything is now ready for the second section of the match between J. H. Zukertort and Wilhelm Steinitz , the greatest chess players of the day . 
The number of games to be played here will be at least three , and probably more . 
The stakes are $ 2,000 a side , and the time limit is fifteen moves per hour . 
The umpires will be Ben R. Foster for Steinitz and William Duncan for Zukertort . 
The contest will open at Harmonie Club , Olive and Eighteenth Streets , at 2 ' oclock this afternoon . 
No tickets will be disposed of at the door , and they can be secured only from the members of the Committee on Arrangements . 
The New York Chess Club has made preparations for exhibiting each move as it is telegraphed on , as well as any interesting events of the match . 
The New York Evening Telegram will have a reporter for its paper . 
Henry Turner , President of the Brooklyn chess club , is in the city , and will witness the contest . 
" The first five games " , says a gentleman writing from the East , " were very unsatisfactory . 
Both players played badly and did themselves no credit . 
The games will not bear analysis , and only prove that earlier the players are entirely out of practice or are not possessed of sufficient nerve to play for such high stakes , or that they have deteriorated in their play . " 
Spectators will be permitted to use pocket chess boards only for following the games , but no analysis of them is allowed and loud conversation can not be indulged in . 
The Secretary of the Chess , Checker , and Whist Club , S. M. Joseph , 103 North Broadway , will furnish tickets on application to him . 
A large attendance at the match is expected .

The Child Market in Germany 
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A SAD SIGHT THE OTHER DAY IN Friedrichshafen , Germany , when the century-old child labor market was resumed . 
Exposed advantageously in a public place , three or four hundred boys and girls were to be seeen – none of them more than fourteen years of age – to be sent out into a seven-months bondage to the highest bidders . 
Intensely humiliating it must have been to these little people to be scrutinised by bull-necked farmers ; to be pinched and poked ; have their merits or demerits discussed for all the world as if they were a lot of calves or chickens . 
The less attractive of the outfit were sold cheap and at bargain prices – probably to the more ignorant , miserly and grasping of the frontier farmers . 
Once bound over in this temporary servitude , there was no law to protect them . 
As their masters directed , they could be used for " cattle herding , housework , stable cleaning , nursing children , feeding cattle or running errands . " 
They were to become household and farm drudges , were to be denied all the privileges of childhood or of freedom – were to become the property of their virtual owners , duly paid for , articles and receipted . 
And for this transaction the parents received sums ranging from $ 12.50 to $ 20 . 
In America we are more refined in matters of this sort . 
We do not ostentatiously sell our children into slavery . 
There is no public market as there is for flowers , cattle , or vegetables . 
We would revolt at the very idea . 
Yet , who can see the children trooping home from the factory , carrying their little dinner pails , their faces sad and wan and pinched , without wondering who has sold them to this service ? 
Their puny bodies are converted into human machinery . 
They are but so many cogs in the remorseless wheel of industry . 
They are not learning anything in the department stores and the factories . 
They are not expected to develop skill . 
Their little lives are consecrated to dull routine ; the endless spinning and grinding and hammering of the modern workshop . 
They do not enjoy even the open air and the freedom of movement of the children on the Bavarian and Tyrolean farms . 
Their days and years are regulated by the factory whistle and the time clock . 
Slaves to the wheel , they have no opportunity of mastering a trade or handicraft . 
The conditions under which they work are too often demoralising . 
Young girls are allowed to mingle promiscuously in the workshops with grown men . 
They are not paid " living wages , " but are informed that their time during the evening is their own . 
Their minds , being unoccupied during the monotonous working hours , are not improved . 
The tawdry attractions of the nickel theaters and the penny arcades afford the only relaxation that they know . 
Ohio , tardily enough , has passed an efficient child labor law . 
By virtue of this measure , children under school age can no longer be exploited in the shops and factories . 
The State must first give them a chance and protect them both from grasping parents and unscrupulous employers . 
But there are too few States in which such legislation has been enacted . 
President Roosevelt in a recent message has made clear the necessity for a Federal child labor law . 
The District of Columbia , which , being under the direct jurisdiction of Congress , ought to be a model commonwealth , is particularly flagrant in its disregard for the rights of the children . 
While such conditions exist it ill behooves us to shudder at the Friedrichshafen labor market , for we are conducting similar institutions ourselves , only not so openly .

The Latest Murder 
It was probably not committed by " Jack the Ripper . " 
The doctors convinced that there are two series of crimes and two men who commit them - One a more skilful dissector than the other - another compromise rejected . 
London , Sept 11 - Although the murder discovered early yesterday morning in the Whitechapel street is generally spoken of as the mysterious " Jack the Ripper " , a close examination of all the facts leads that this murder is not of the ripper series . 
The police and the medical men familiar with the details of the recent London horrors of this class say that this murder must be classified with those known as the embankment murders , of which there have now been four in all , including the one in which the headless body of the victim was recently discovered in Chelsea , and of which the head has never been found . 
Although there is a general resemblance between the horrible work of the two murderers , both taking special pains to mutilate their victims and to carry off portions of the bodies , each carries off a different portion . 
Besides this there are other evidences of difference in expertness in the surgical work involved in all the mutilations , the embankment murderer being by far the more scientific of the two . 
For some time it was doubtful whether all these horrors were the work of one or two persons , but this last murder convinces the medical men that there are two entirely distinct sets of murders and two different men responsible for them . 
It is believed that in the present instance the body was purposely brought to the Whitechapel district to throw the police off the scent by inducing the belief that the body was that of another victim of Jack the Ripper . 
In this the peretrator , however , went to trouble that is entirely superfluous for the police are as much in the fog about the one class of murders as the other .

THE SCREEN 
Douglas Fairbanks 's latest motion picture , " The Mark of Zorro , " is at the Capitol this week . 
The program says that it is " from " a story by Johnston McCulley , called " The Curse of Capistrano , " but one who has not read Mr. McCulley 's story imagines that it is pretty far from it . 
There 's too much Fairbanks in it for any one to have written it without the athletic comedian definitely in mind . 
What is on the screen is probably " The Curse of Capistrano " spiced and speeded up to suit the taste of Douglas Fairbanks and the many who enjoy his gay and lively style of playing . 
This means that whatever plausibility there was in the original has been sacrificed for headlong action , that whatever consistence there was has given place to intermittent fun and thrills , that whatever of sentiment there was has become romantic nonsense . 
All of which may mean that " The Mark of Zorro " is more enjoyable than " The Curse of Capistrano " could ever hope to be . 
Certainly there are moments in the motion picture which must delight anyone , no matter how preposterous they are . 
There is a duel scene , for example , which is something distinctly original in the history of mortal combat on the stage or screen , and there are spirited races and pursuits , sudden appearances , quick changes , and flashes of tempestuous love-making that are typically , and entertainingly , Fairbanksian . 
But " The Mark of Zorro " is also different in some respects from the usual Fairbanks picture . 
It is somewhat tamer , for one thing , the scenery especially having more of the quality of inertia . 
There are no mountain slides or floods in it , and the hero himself actually appears sometimes as a constitutionally languid individual , wearied by the exertions of a carriage ride . 
He is one Don Diego Vega , an aristocrat of Spanish California , who seems content to loaf through life in fancy clothes and rich surroundings , but is really so moved by the tyranny of his country 's rulers that he originates for himself another role , that of Senor Zorro , an alert and mysterious avenger of the people 's wrongs , who appears suddenly when least expected by the authorities , and disappears as suddenly when most desired by them , always in black mask and costume , with a sure sword , a swift horse and a sense of humor . 
There may be those who will find " The Mark of Zorro " a little tedious in places because Fairbanks is not frolicking through every scene of it , and , as he never creates a character and will not confine himself to any possible plot or plan , his pictures must depend almost entirely upon his own athletics and absurdities , supplemented by those of scenery and cast . 
So , whenever " The Mark of Zorro " calms down , something seems to be missing . 
The settings of the picture are picturesquely , and some of them magnificently , Spanish , and they often contract amusingly with the emphatically non-Spanish appearance of some of the players , including , of course , Fairbanks himself . 
Still , the cast does what is expected of it , and , as no one cares whether the story is consistently Spanish or just outlandish , there 's no fault to find . 
Those who do the principal work are Noah Berry , Marguerite De La Motte and Robert McKim . 
The production was well-directed by Fred Niblo . 
" Heliotrope , " adapted from a story by Richard Washburn Child and directed by George D. Baker , who also wrote the scenario , is at the Rivoli this week . 
It is a melodrama which might have been a tragedy . 
It deals in mechanically contrived situations when it might have dealt in character . 
The story , briefly , is of an imprisoned criminal who obtains a pardon in order to protect his daughter from an unscrupulous mother . 
The girl is about to make an advantageous marriage to a man who knows nothing of her antecedents , and the mother is preparing to blackmail the prospective husband . 
The father has given his word that he will not kill the woman , so , by an ingenious method of putting terror into her heart , he drives her to kill him . 
She is arrested for the murder , and , the girl 's birth certificate having been destroyed by the father before his death , she is powerless . 
The last scene is of the girl 's presumably happy wedding . 
Herein the tragedy of the father 's sacrifice , brightened by its success , and the irony of the daughter 's unsuspecting happiness might have been developed if father and daughter had been made genuine characters . 
But they have not been , and so the story is simply a melodrama , interesting as such , and possibly destined to greater popularity than it would have had as a more human document . 
William D. Mack , in the minor rôle of " Spike " Foley , a pal of the father , is the most lifelike person in the cast . 
Fred Burton , as the father , and Julia Swayne Gordon , as the mother , have flashes of genuineness , but , for the most part , follow the broad , exaggerated style of acting suited to melodrama . 
Diana Allen , as the girl , and Wilfred Lytell , as her fiancé , are just two young people . 
Thomas J. Findlay , as a prison warden , is satisfactory . 
The direction of Mr. Baker has produced many scenes photographically excellent , but few of cinematographic distinction . 
The Rivoli Pictorial includes , among other interesting subjects , amusing animal studies from the Urban studio , and a act of Marcus 's entertaining drawings with movable whiskers .

The Siege Of Mafeking . 
( FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT . ) 
MAFEKING , JAN. 3 . 
The enemy have received a New Year 's gift from Pretoria in the shape of a new gun and three wagon loads of ammunition . 
The bombardment consequently has continued more vigorously since . 
The new gun fires shells charged with a chemical liquid , which ignites upon contact with the air . 
This weapon has effected no damage hitherto , with the exception of a few minor fires in the gardens of Mafeking . 
The resistance of the garrison is goading the Boers to commit various atrocities . 
Despite innumerable warnings they have concentrated their fire during the last two days upon the women 's laager and hospital . 
Children have been killed and women mutilated by the bursting of shells . 
These \nces are fanning a spirit of revenge in the breasts of the townspeople . 
It is no longer possible to guarantee the safety of the women and children of Mafeking , despite every precaution . 
Colonel Baden-Powell has stated that it is impossible to rely upon Boer honour . 
The scenes of terror and consternation among the women folk are pitiable in the extreme . 
Colonel Baden-Powell and Major Goold Adams have deposed Wessels , chief of the tribe of the Baralongs , who had quarters at Mafeking . 
Wessels has lately been intractable . 
He spread false reports among the tribes that the military authorities were endeavouring to make the natives slaves . 
The government of the tribe has been given over to two chief councillors , and a better feeling is already being established . 
Adverting to my telegram describing the Game Tree fight , there is no longer any doubt that the Boers used explosive bullets . 
The strictest and most impartial inquiry has been held among troopers and officers , the results of which have been embodied in a report . 
I have interviewed Surgeon-Major Anderson , an Imperial Service officer sent out by the Director of Hospitals to Colonel Baden-Powell 's force , who authorizes me to say that the wounds inflicted were altogether different to previous experience in Egypt and in India , and that it was impossible they could have been produced by Martini or Mauser bullets , though perhaps they might have been caused by Snider ones , but from a scrutiny of the wounds made while dressing them in hospital here he has no doubt in his own mind that bullets of an explosive character were used by the Boers .

Three Grades of Fabric 
Police , Navy Yard and Militia Officers Invited to Local Test Arranged for To-morrow Night . 
The Rev. Casimir Zeglen of St. Stanislaus ' Roman Catholic Church in Chicago , the largest Polish church in the country , there being 40,000 souls in the parish , has invented a bullet proof cloth which has stood the test of many shots of all calibers fired at all distances . 
Mr. Zeglen is a young priest , about 35 years of age . 
He began experimenting on bullet proof cloth fifteen years ago , using steel shavings , moss , hair , etc. but nothing stood the test until he made use of silk . 
All early experiments produced an inflexible cloth which was more in the nature of a coat of mail . 
After the assassination of Mayor Carter Harrison in Chicago Mr. Zeglen renewed his efforts to find a bullet proof material and determined to use silk . 
A problem , however , presented itself in securing perfection of weave , and this was not made possible until he visited Vienna and Aachen , in Germany , where there are great weaving mills , manned by Polaks , who are renowned for their skill in weaving . 
A fabric produced there , which is one-eighth of an inch in thickness , four ply , presents this perfection of weave , and all efforts to penetrate it with bullets has proved futile . 
The Rev. Mr. Zeglen himself submitted to a test in Chicago . 
He put on a vest of the material and an expert revolver shot fired at the vest at eight paces and no one of the bullets at all disturbed Mr. Zeglen . 
The weight of the fabric is half a pound to the square foot . 
It is soft and flexible , so that all kinds of garments can be manufactured out of it . 
The most practical form of garment is a vest , which can be worn at all times as a protection to life . 
The second kind of fabric is a simple textile goods , being an inch thick and weighing two pounds to the square foot . 
This fabric resists and wards off all kinds of leaden bullets from military rifles at any distance , dum-dum bullets at a range of 400 yards and steel bullets at a distance of 800 yards . 
The third kind of fabric is also of silk , textile , one inch thick , covered on the outside with a steel armor one-sixteenth of an inch in thickness . 
The silk and steel together weigh four pounds to the square foot , and the armor wards off steel bullets from military rifles at a range of 250 yards . 
The same steel bullets can be warded off at a range of 200 , 100 and 50 yards , but the steel armor must be increased to the thickness of one-tenth of an inch and at a range of 50 yards to one-eight of an inch . 
Tests of this fabric have been made in a number of places , and they have all been successful . 
One of the most important was at Fort Sheridan . 
Krag-Jorgensen bullets were fired at a distance of 200 and 300 yards . 
At the 300-yard range the bullet perforated the steel and imbedded itself in the second thickness of the cloth . 
At the range of 200 yards the bullet pierced the entire shield , but the steel mantel of the bullet stopped at the third thickness . 
A test was made at Chelsea , Mass. , before Chief of Police Hudson , who fired a shot at the vest seven paces away with a 44-caliber pistol , but the bullet failed to pierce the cloth . 
C.W. Ryder , who is exhibiting the armor cloth in Brooklyn , has arranged for a test in the Montauk Theater building next Tuesday at 3:30 P.M. , to which the police , Navy Yard officers , militia officers and others will be invited . 
A 22-caliber pistol , a 32-caliber revolver , and a 44-caliber Russian revolver , the largest made , will be fired . 
Smokeless powder will be used . 
Dr. Ashley A. Webber , who is known as one of the greatest marksmen in the country , will fire the shots . 
Mr. Ryder has made an offer of $ 500 reward if Dr. Webber succeeds in penetrating the fabric . 
It is expected that the Rev. Mr. Zeglen will be present in person to wear the vest .

Throng at Smallpox Case 
While the chauffeur and male nurse on the city ambulance devoted to the carrying of smallpox cases drove from the General Hospital to the municipal garage on the North Side today to have engine trouble " fixed " a man , his face and hands covered with smallpox pustules , lay in one of the entrances to the Union Station . 
One hour and fifteen minutes after having been given the call the chauffeur and nurse reported at the hospital with the man , G.T. Brewer , 926 West Forty-second St reet . 
The ambulance had been repaired . 
Behind that vehicle was an ambulance from the Emergency Hospital , ordered to get the patient by Dr. James Tyree , in charge of contagious diseases , after repeated calls from the station . 
Brewer , a life insurance agent , arrived from Cherryvale , Kas. , this morning . 
At 9 o'clock James McManus , officer in charge of the police station at the depot , found him lying in the west entrance to the lobby . 
Streams of persons , hurrying past , eddied about Brewer while solicitous passersby asked the trouble . 
At 9:50 McManus placed a policeman near the sick man to keep persons away . 
McManus says he called the contagious department of the hospital immediately after finding Brewer . 
An ambulance was promised . 
Two calls were sent the hospital later and each time , so McManus says , he was told the ambulance was on the way . 
Doctor Tyree once insisted McManus take the sick man into the police office there , but McManus refused , saying more persons would be exposed . 
Doctor Tyree also said the ambulance would be there " right away . " 
When the ambulance did reach the station at 10:15 , the driver explained it had been broken down while out on another call . 
Doctor Tyree explained later that the regular sick ambulance , No. 90 , was wrecked last night . 
When the call first was received at the receiving ward of the General Hospital at 9:05 o'clock ambulance No. 92 , the smallpox carrier , was dispatched , he sa id . 
" But the ambulance had motor trouble , " Doctor Tyree continued . 
" The chauffeur and the male nurse in charge decided to go to the municipal garage and get the trouble fixed . " 
The garage , on the North Side , is about as far from the hospital as the distance from the hospital to the Union Station and return .
