MILAN MOTOR RACES . 
TRACK AND ROAD COURSE . 
( from our corresponent . ) 
MILAN , Sept. 3 . 
- Heavy rainfall did not prevent thousands of people from crowding to the new Milan motor race track for the first day of the race week . 
Signor Facta , the Prime Minister , was among those present . 
The Milan meeting is attracting special attention because of the new course , which presents some novel and interesting features . 
It has been constructed in the Royal Park of Monza , ten miles from Milan , and is different from all the others now existing . 
The course covers ten kilometres [ 6.2 miles ] , of which 4 ½ kilometres consist of a track and the rest of a road circuit . 
Hitherto , motor races have been run either on open road circuits adapted for the occasion , as in Italy and France , or on closed tracks , as at Brooklands and Indianapolis . 
The Monza track combines the two , giving greater safety and at the same time the possibility of reaching high speed . 
Cars can pass from the track to the road circuit and cover the whole ten kilometres without interruption . 
Stands with accommodation for twenty thousand people have been built . 
Five nations will compete on the circuit on December 10 for the Grand Prix of the Automobile Club of Italy : England , with three Sunbeams , Italy , with three Fiats and three Bianchis , France , with four Rolland-Pilains , three Bugattis , and one Delage , Germany , with three Mercédès , four Benzes , and three Heims , Austria , with three Austrian Daimlers . 
The Fiats took the lead in to-day 's racing . 
Bordino covered 600 kilometers [ 372.8 miles ] in 4hrs , 28min . 32sec. , and the second and third arrivals in that race were both Fiats .

MURDER IN WESTMINSTER 
Shortly before eleven o'clock , on Saturday night , a man named John Brown murdered his wife Sarah by cutting her head nearly off , at the house at which they lived , No. 11 , Regent-gardens , Regency-street , Westminster . 
The deceased was a laundress , and her husband is employed as a roadman in St. James 's Park . 
On the 17th ult . she summoned him to the Westminster Police-court , before Mr. D'Eyncourt , for maintenance , on the ground of having been deserted for a period of six weeks . 
The deceased then produced a medical certificate to the effect that her husband 's violent conduct and excitable temperament justified her in refusing to cohabit with him . 
The magistrate made no order for support , and the woman seems shortly afterwards to have very reluctantly resumed cohabitation with her husband , who was very jealous of her , and has frequently been heard to threaten her , asserting that she had been unfaithful - a statement for which there did not appear to be the slightest foundation . 
On Saturday night , at ten minutes to eleven , a next-door neighbour heard the pair quarrelling in their room , which was a front apartment on the ground floor . 
The noise suddenly ceased , and a minute or two afterwards the man left the house hurriedly , loudly slamming the front door , and walked at once to the Rochester-row Police-station , where he told Inspector Fairey , A Division , who was on duty , that he had murdered his wife by cutting her throat . 
He handed the inspector a large spring-backed clasp-knife , which had marks of blood on it , as also had his clothes , and described how he had twice stabbed the woman in the neck . 
Detective-sergeant Waldock , of the Criminal Investigation Department , was at once despatched to investigate the matter , and found the deceased with her head nearly cut from her body in a pool of blood near the fireplace in the room . 
Dr. Archer , of Vincent-square , Westminster , was sent for , and he found the body still warm , but life was extinct . 
The doctor expressed the opinion that great force must have been employed to have cut the woman 's throat in such a shocking way , for there were two distinct gashes , and the wind-pipe was severed . 
The two little children belonging to the deceased were crying in the passage , and were taken away by neighbours . 
The man Brown , who is forty-five years of age , a little older than the deceased , was subsequently formally charged with wilful murder , and he will be brought before the magistrate at the Westminster Police-court this morning .

Four Cars in Thrilling Crash in Front of Main Grandstand . 
Wescott Mechanician Suffers Serious Hurts . 
S. P. DICKSON , OF AMPLEX NO. 44 , INSTANTLY KILLED 
CROWD IN GRAND STAND SHUDDERS AT CRASH NEAR PITS . 
FIRST REPORTED MANY DEAD 
Case Car Breaks Steering Gear — Hearne 's Fiat , Case ; Apperson Jack Rabbit and Wescott Clash — One Man , Crazed by Drive , Leaps From Car and Is Hurt 
INDIANAPOLIS MOTOR SPEEDWAY , May 30 . 
— 
One man was killed and half a dozen more or less seriously injured during the five-hundred-mile race this afternoon . 
Death came early in the race , but the sensational accident of the day was at 1:30 , when four cars were wrecked almost directly in front of the grand stand . 
The only person who was seriously hurt was John Glover , mechanician for Westcott car No. 7 , driven by Harry Knight who also was hurt . 
The other cars that were wrecked were Eddie Hearne 's Fiat No. 18 , Joe Jagersberger Case No. 8 and Lytle 's Apperson Jack Rabbit No. 35 . 
That several people were not killed was a mystery to the great crowd in the grand stands . 
The Case No. 8 , coming down the home stretch , carrying Jagersberger and his mechanician D. Anderson , broke a steering knuckle and crashed into the cement wall . 
The car rebounded to the center of the track with crushed wheels , and Anderson fell directly in the roadway . 
Could Only Check Racers . 
Starter Wagner made an effort to flag the racers that followed , but he could do little more than check their speed . 
Harry Knight in his Westcott , who was the closest to No. 8 , turned out toward the judge 's stand to avoid striking the prostrate mechanician , and his car skidded sideways at great speed . 
At the pits near the south end were Lytle 's car and Eddie Hearne 's Fiat No. 18 , which had stopped because of the tire trouble . 
Knight 's car crashed into them with such terrific force that both 18 and 35 were dragged along to the roadway opposite the gate . 
Cars Turn Over . 
The impact caused No. 7 to turn over , throwing Knight and his mechanician , John Glover , some distance . 
In the meantime Wagner was endangering his life in the center of the track checking the flyers . 
However , when it was seen that all the wrecked cars were free of the course he waved them ahead , and the men were tearing around like mad trying to make up for time lost . 
Taken to Hospital . 
At the hospital an examination showed that Knight was not as seriously injured as was first supposed and after being treated by some physicians he was sent to him home . 
Glover appeared to be the worse injured of the two and the physicians were unable to determine the exact nature of his injuries . 
When Anderson fell on the track he was not badly hurt and after lying there a few seconds he jumped up and limped to a place of safety . 
The accident happened in the most crowded part of the course , and perhaps half of the estimated attendance of 100,000 saw it . 
As if by common impulse the thousands of people in the stands arose and a cry of horror was heard . 
At first it was thought a number of people about the crowded pits had been killed . 
Death and serious injury was dealt , first in the thirtieth mile , and again when nearly 100 miles of the race had been run . 
The accident to the Amplex that resulted in the instant death of S. P. Dickson , mechanician , wrought up the crowd , and when Lozier car No. 34 , driven by Teddy Tetzlaff , was seen to veer in front of another car the spectators gasped . 
There was a crash , and the Lozier was overturned . 
Tetzlaff 's mechanician , David Lewis , suffered a broken leg , but Tetzlaff was only bruised . 
The car that crashed in from behind , Pope-Hartford , No. 5 , was withdrawn with the Lozier . 
The Pope occupants were not hurt . 
Had Narrow Escapes . 
Louis Disbrow and Richard Uliarechib , in Pope , had a narrow escpae . 
The cars were coming down the home stretch when at a point just north of the bridge Tetzlaff 's car burst a rear tire . 
This caused his machine to swerve into Disbrow 's car , overturning the Lozier and causing the Pope-Hartford to spin around several times on the track until it stopped near the pole . 
The Lozier also stopped near the pole and the men dragged the cars out of the way of the other racers that were thundering down the course . 
At the hospital where Lewis was taken an examination showed that his leg was broken . 
Tetzlaff was only shaken up . 
S. P. Dickon , mechanician for Arthur Greiner , driver of Amplex car No. 44 , was the first victim of the race . 
Shortly after the thirtieth mile , Greiner was sweeping around the back stretch when both rear tires exploded , wrecking the car . 
Dickson was instantly killed , Greiner was seriously injured . 
Greiner is a millionaire driver from Chicago , who came here and volunteered his services to the Amplex people , following the wreck of the Amplex car No. 12 several days ago , in which Joe Horan was injured . 
Taken to the Hospital . 
The ambulance was sent across the field and Greiner and the body of Dickson were taken to the hospital . 
After an examination it was said that Greiner had a fracture of the skull and a broken arm . 
The machine left the track and turned over , Dickson being crushed beneath it and Greiner being thrown a distance of about twenty-five feet . 
There had been more or less concern among the racing men for a week concerning the Amplex cars . 
One of them , No. 12 , had several accidents and was withdrawn . 
Dickson Lived in Chicago 
Dickson 's body was badly lacerated . 
After Greiner had been examined in the hospital the physicians said he did not seem to be as badly injured as was first supposed . 
Dickson lived in Chicago and his father is Major Dickson , on the editorial staff of the Chicago Record Herald . 
He was twenty-four years old and unmarried . 
He was known as an experienced man in the racing game . 
Many People Leave . 
However , all jumped to places of safety when they saw Knight 's car coming them broadside . 
Not a few of the horror-stricken people in the grand stand evidentally had enough of the race , which was only half through , and left the grounds . 
As it was there was a tremendous feeling of relief when it became generally known there were no lives lost in this accident . 
So much excitement was caused in the judges ' and timers ' stands that the time for the 250 miles was overlooked . 
Thrilling Escape From Injury . 
The crowd again was brought to its feet by the thrilling escape from injury or death of Howard Fry , driving a Mercer , as a substitute for Bigelow . 
Fry 's car skidded and plunged toward the repair pits across from the grandstand . 
He turned it back to the middle of the track , but the car was too wild for him to handle and swerved toward the pits again . 
Fry then kicked his brake and the car swung fully around before it stopped . 
Amid a storm of cheers from the crowd Fry resumed the race . 
Bob Evans Injured . 
Another accident that added one more to the list of injured , happened on the back stretch , about 2:30 . 
Bob Evans , a relief driver in charge of Jackson No. 26 , was sprinting along the stretch , when he attempted to turn out for another car . 
His racer skidded and when the wheels slipped from the edge of the track , Evans was thrown out and an ankle was broken . 
With the aid of his mechanician he climbed back into the car , which had come to a standstill , and drove back to the pits on the home stretch , from where he was sent to the hospital . 
Jack Tower , the regular driver , then took charge of the car and continued in the race .

STORM DAMAGE ALONG THE MIDWAY . 
Reckoning After the Tempest Shows Many Dilapidated Tents and Signs . 
The Storm of Thursday night was the most severe of the season , according to the automatic instruments at the Weather Bureau exhibit . 
Rain commenced falling at 8:10 p.m. , and between 8:14 and 8:26 one-fifth of an inch fell , being at the rate of 2.50 inches an hour , while from 8:15 to 8:18 it fell at the rate of six inches an hour . 
At 8:10 the wind blew at the rate of sixty-six miles an hour , while the temperature fell 10 ° . 
Considerable damage was done on Midway . 
At the Indian Village the main tent was blown down and it was not until noon yesterday that it was replaced . 
The Ferris Wheel kept people in who did not want to go out in the storm and closed the ticket offices , taking those in around twelve times . 
Two engineers who happened to be in the wheel said they would not take a large sum of money for the experience . 
At the wheel the weather gauge registered a velocity of sixty-six miles an hour for the wind . 
The Lapland Village had a great deal of canvas blown away . 
Forty big stag heads adorned the tent , each with full branching horns , and these fell among the girl performers as the tent went down , but no one was badly bruised . 
The Laplanders in all the tents were drowned out and had to take refuge in the offices . 
In Old Vienna some windows were blown in and awnings ruined , but the chief loss was caused by the people who went away in the excitement without paying their bills , it being estimated that the loss was $ 600 .

The Lynching of John Heith 
TOMBSTONE , Arizona , Feb. 23 . 
— 
At 9 o'clock on Thursday morning Judge Pinney sentenced John Heith to confinement in Yuma Penitentiary for life for complicity in the Bisbee murders . 
Twenty-four hours later the dead body of Heith dangled from the cross bar of a telegraph pole near the foot of Toughnut Street , where it was suspended by a rope . 
The following are the particulars of the occurrence as near as can be gathered : About 8:30 yesterday morning a crowd of men , mostly miners , numbering about 150 , proceeded to the Courthouse . 
Arriving there they detailed seven of their number from Bisbee , who entered and demanded that John Heith be turned over to them . 
The seven men approached the door leading to the corridor of the jail and one of them knocked . 
Being about time for the Chinaman who brings food for the prisoners to arrive , Jailer Ward opened the door unsuspiciously , and was immediately covered by weapons and told to give up the keys of the jail . 
Seeing any attempt at resistance would be useless he did as requested , and in a few minutes the deputation was in the presence of the sought-for man . 
The crowd , which by this time had filled the spacious hall , started for the street . 
At the door they were met by Sheriff Ward , who called on them in the name of the law to desist . 
The Sheriff was picked up and gently removed down the steps out of the way , while the crowd started down the street on a run . 
The rope had been placed around Heith 's body , and about 20 men had hold of it . 
It never became taut during the run , the prisoner keeping up with the crowd , and showing no signs of the white feather . 
Arriving at the place selected for the hanging one of the party climbed a telegraph pole and passed the rope over the cross-bar . 
Heith pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and , placing it on his knee , coolly and deliberately folded it , and , placing it over his eyes , asked someone in the crowd to tie it . 
This being done , he informed the crowd they were hanging an innocent man , and would find it out when the others ( meaning Dowd and his companions ) were hanged . 
He told them he had faced death too often to be afraid , and had but one request to make , namely , that they would not shoot into his body . 
He was told his last wish would be respected and he told them he was ready . 
Countless hands grasped the rope . 
A run was made , and in a twinkling the man was suspended to the pole . 
The news spread about town rapidly , and in a few minutes an immense crowd of men , women , and children congregated on the scene . 
The universal expression was , " Served him right . " 
That this opinion should be so prevalent is no doubt the result of the testimony at the trial , which was convincing to any mind of ordinary intelligence , that Heith was a guilty accessory to the Bisbee murders . 
The Coroner 's jury found as a verdict that Heith came to his death from " emphysema , which might have been caused by strangulation , self-inflicted or otherwise . " 
A placard was posted on the telegraph pole where Heith was found suspended and dead with the following inscription : " John Heith was hanged to this pole by citizens of Cochise County for participation in the Bisbee massacre as a proved accessory at 8:20 A.M. , Feb 22 , 1884 to advance Arizona . " 
RIVIERA , February 25th . 
Everything is delightfully foreign in this ménage ; Genevra lives in an apartment , as most people do here ; hers is on the second floor , with a huge salon on one side of the hall , a salle à manger on the other , and the usual complement of bedrooms , kitchens , and the like . 
This is quite different from anything we have in America , where the apartments are on a scale of princely magnificence , with prices to match , or of a simplicity so extreme that " flat " seems to designate appropriately both them and the condition of those who inhabit them . 
This apartment is really a house on one floor ; the entrance and stone stairway are quite palatial , and yet it is à bon marché . 
The drawing-room is spacious , with windows to the floor , opening out on balconies on which we step out to see the bersaglieri drill in the evenings , as the children are on the qui vive from the moment the spirited music reaches their ears . 
Genevra 's large salon is heated by an open fire of olive-wood , which she says makes it warm enough except when the winters are unusually cold . 
The English ladies who come to tea in the afternoon throw aside their wraps , exclaiming , " Ah , Mrs. Fuller 's drawing-room is always so very hot ! " 
Hot is not exactly the word that I should apply to dear Genevra 's pretty drawing-room , although I know that Lucie and Marthe are piling on extra wood all the time in compliment to Mademoiselle , the shivering American . 
Everything in this house moves with a delightful smoothness and ease , and the whole atmosphere of the place is indescribably restful . 
When I awake in the morning I touch a bell , which soon brings to my bedside the trim , neat-handed Lucie with rolls and coffee . 
This morning my breakfast-tray was glorified with great bunches of dark purple and light Neapolitan violets . " 
What is the meaning of this reckless extravagance ? " 
I call out to Genevra , whose room is next to mine . " 
Extravagance , ma belle ! " 
replies Genevra . " 
Flowers are one of the economies of San Remo . 
If I were to carpet your path with violets it would be a cheap pleasure for me at the rate of two soldi a bunch ! " 
Was n't that like Genevra ? 
- like the old Genevra , yet with a certain grace learned from these charming Italians ! 
Only half believing her , and yet comforted by her assurances , I enjoy the delicious fragrance of the violets while I luxuriously sip my coffee and read the opening pages of Ruffini 's " Doctor Antonio . " 
Yesterday we drove to Bordighera , and Genevra and I tried to find the place near Ospedaletti where Sir John Davenne 's coach came to grief by the roadside . 
It was disappointing to find no trace of Rosa 's little inn , only great hotels , a casino , and all manner of extravagant and unromantic modern innovations . 
The sea and the picturesque coast are fortunately the same , and Genevra pointed out to me the great rock near which Battista rowed Lucy 's boat while Antonio told Sir John how cleverly the valiant citizens of Bordighera had here outwitted the British in their brig-of-war . 
And on this road the Doctor walked home by moonlight , after an evening with Sir John and Lucy , singing " O bell ' alma innamorata ! " 
Poor , dear , brave Antonio - love , dear love , treated him shabbily enough ! 
Your mother will remember reading this story to me on one of my early visits to Woodford . 
Although I was but a child then , my wrath rose hot against Lucy 's treatment of Antonio . 
After her marriage with Lord Cleverton I refused to listen to another word about the faithless Lucy , until curiosity and a real fondness for the pretty blonde heroine sent me back to this saddest of stories , over which I wept as girls of an earlier time wept over " The Sorrows of Werther . " 
This digression is all apropos of Bordighera , which is most interesting aside from its associations with Lucy and her lover , with its enchanting Coast Promenade ending at the Spianata del Capo . 
From this promontory there is a noble view of Ventimiglia , Mentone , Monaco , Villafranca and its light-house ; beyond is the long , low line of the French shore , and still beyond , the Maritime Alps , with flecks of snow upon their sides , while near us , at our feet , lies the bay of Ospedaletti , sparkling in the sun . 
Bordighera is literally framed in by palm-trees - palms to right , to left , everywhere . 
No wonder that this little town long had the exclusive honor of supplying the palms to St. Peter 's in Rome for Palm Sunday ; but thereby hangs a tale which I may not relate to-day , as Genevra bids me drop my pen and join her and her friends over a cup of tea . 
NAPLES , March 2d . 
If Lady Morgan wrote of her beloved Irish capital " dear , dirty Dublin , " we may describe Naples less alliteratively in somewhat the same words , except that to American eyes the Neapolitan city is even dirtier and vastly more beautiful . 
Indeed , no words written nor pictures painted give any adequate conception of the blueness of the sea , the soft purple shades upon the mountains , and the fine transparency and lightness of this air . 
One breathes in gayety with every breath , a certain elasticity and joie de vivre which the filth , the noise , the bad odors , and even the hopeless poverty all around us are powerless to dispel . 
From the Strada Vittorio Emanuele , where we are stopping , we look down upon a series of terraced gardens , some of them very poor little gardens with a few vegetables , among them the omnipresent and much beloved artichoke , the fennel , like a coarse celery , and lettuce . 
Roses are climbing all over the walls of these hillside gardens , and in many of them orange-trees are blooming , spreading around them a delicious perfume . 
Here on the heights we have none of the disadvantages of Naples , the noise , the unsavory odors , or the uncleanliness . 
Above this strada , which is the name by which the Neapolitans call their streets , the hills tower for many feet , and way up on their crests are the Castle of St. Elmo and the old Carthusian monastery of San Martino . 
We visited San Martino the day after our arrival , because Zelphine had an irrepressible desire to get to the tip-top of everything and view both the city and bay from the heights above us . 
The ascent was made in one of the funicolari , cable trams , which are used so much over here . 
They are rather terrifying at first , but are said to be quite safe , and are , I believe , less dangerous than many of our elevators . 
[ Illustration : The Bay of Naples ] The old monastery is now a museum , under the management of the Museo Nazionale , and contains many paintings , porcelains , carvings , and other antiques . 
We neglected the treasures within for the greater pleasure of wandering at will through the charming , picturesque cloisters , which are richly carved and of a stone warm and creamy in tone , so different from the heavy , dark cloisters one sees in England and elsewhere . 
Most of our morning was spent basking in the sunshine of the court ; we could fancy the old monks enjoying , as we did , the genial warmth that in the Southern Italian winter is only to be found out of doors . 
The museum itself was damp , as are all the galleries at this season . 
In this court are a number of handsome sarcophagi , with inscriptions and coats-of-arms carved in the marble ; from hence we passed into the Belvedere , whose balconies command an exquisite view of the city and bay . 
We gazed long at the noble panorama spread before us , from Posilipo to the hill of Capodimonte . 
Over across the bay were Ischia and Capri , blue as its own grotto , with Sorrento 's long point of land reaching out into the sea , and off in the far distance the snow-line of the Apennines . 
To our left , Vesuvius , with its three peaks , was smoking away as peacefully as a Hollander on his hooge stoep . 
Seeing them by day it is hard to believe that these fair blue hills could have wrought sudden destruction upon the cities of the plain ; but last night , when flames flashed up skyward from the smoking crater , I must confess that we had some misgivings . 
When we beheld these danger-signals , as they seemed to us , we carried our fears and our queries to the padrone and the concierge , who both assured us , to their own satisfaction if not entirely to ours , that Vesuvius has never erupted in the direction of Naples , evidently feeling that Italian volcanoes , like Italian people , are not in the habit of changing their ways . 
Standing upon the Belvedere of San Martino , we were able to form some idea of the great width of the bay , where just now " William 's yacht , " as one of our English friends always calls it , is riding at anchor . 
The Kaiser is making one of his rapid , semi-official , quite friendly , and wholly diplomatic visits to Rome , and his yacht awaits him here . 
NAPLES , March 4th . 
We have spent the morning at the National Museum , where are so many of the world-famous sculptures , the Hercules , a magnificent , strong figure in perfect repose , a giant taking his ease , and the Farnese Bull , both of them from the Baths of Caracalla in Rome , and a huge bronze horse from Herculaneum . 
Most impressive and interesting to us is the statue of Diana of the Ephesians , against whose worship Paul preached at Ephesus . 
A curious statue is this , odd enough to have fallen down from Jupiter , according to the tradition , or from any other heathen god ! 
The torso is of fine , variegated marble , and the head , hands , and feet , the latter slender and delicate , are of bronze . 
This Diana is not a huntress , like the Greek Artemis with the crescent above her brow , but bears about her the symbols of abundance . 
We lingered long near this statue of the great goddess of the Ephesians , marvelling wherein lay the secret of her power . 
To Demetrius and the other silversmiths who made her shrines she was valuable , as she brought them great gain ; but for beauty or grace there was no reason why this Diana should have been worshipped by " Asia and all the world . " 
Among the bronzes from Pompeii and Herculaneum we found the originals of many of the exquisitely graceful figures with which we are all familiar . 
We greeted as old friends the Dancing Faun , the Mercury , the Flying Victory , the Wrestlers , Silenus , the Boy with the Dolphin , and , above all , the lovely Narcissus , which they now call by another name . 
Zelphine and I have decided that we will never acknowledge this to be a Dionysus or anything less poetic than the Narcissus . 
This charming , youthful figure with the bent head and listening ear is quite small , not nearly life-size , and for that reason , perhaps , its beauty is more delicate and spiritual . 
If that little figure could speak , what could it not tell of pomp , luxury , love , and delight , all overtaken and overwhelmed by sudden destruction in the buried city where it was found ! 
Now , indeed , if it were in my power to rhyme four lines and make sense at the same time , which was my school-girl idea of poetry-making , I should certainly be sending you a poem about the Narcissus ; but why cudgel my brains when Keats has , with his own sympathetic charm , told the pathetic story of the beautiful youth ? 
- " Who gazed into the stream 's deep recess And died of his own dear loveliness . " 
On our way home from the museum our vetturino beat his horse so unmercifully , although the poor nag was going as fast as a horse could be expected to go up hill , that Zelphine remonstrated with him , very tactfully , as I thought , paying his sorry Rosinante compliments and calling the wretched beast il buono cavallo . 
The idea of any one feeling compassion for a horse evidently touched the driver 's sense of humor , and , regarding it as a huge joke , he laughed and whipped the poor animal still more unmercifully , making us understand , in the gibberish of French and Italian peculiar to the cabmen here , that there was no need to be merciful to a creature without a soul . 
We longed for greater facility in some language that he could understand , to inquire into his own spiritual condition . 
As , however , words were wanting , we fell to wondering wherein such a being as this differs from the beasts of the field . 
The cabmen of Naples would certainly afford our friend Dr. C. an additional argument in favor of his pet doctrine of conditional immortality . 
Our driver 's attitude toward the animal creation is , we are told , that of most Neapolitans . 
Even persons of more intelligence question the advisability of caring for the comfort of dumb creatures , yet these apparently cruel people have a most kindly custom . 
If parents lose a child , and children are generally so numerous that it seems as if one could scarcely be missed , they adopt an orphan , call it God 's child , and treat it as their own . 
VESUVIUS COMMEND me to a darkening winter afternoon amidst the fires of Vesuvius for bringing the mind down to first principles ! 
This is what we poetise , and paint , and dance on - this Thing that we are come to gaze at here in silence , as it shows through certain cracks in this shell we call the solid earth ! 
“ You are here on sufferance , ” the Thing says to us , “ and you do well to come and see where I show a little bit of myself . 
May it do you good . 
Remember , I am under your feet wherever you go ! ” 
Jan. ‘ 96 - “ To-day the fumes from the nether fires came in gusts through the snorting crater , sending sulphurous smoke rolling down on the keen north wind straight into our labouring lungs as we pounded through the ashes on our way up the ‘ cone . ’ 
There is no getting at all near the hideous mouth ; in attempting any such thing one would very soon be over head and ears in the yellow sulphur and lost beyond recall . 
I thought of the fate of a ‘ mad Englishman , ’ who , in spite of the warning cries of the native guides , made a dart for some outlying lesser crater , declaring he saw a shoe floating in it . 
Trying to hook out this precious ‘ shoe ’ with his walking-stick , he fell in and withered away like a moth in a candle-flame . 
“ I was cheered on to fresh exertions by W. ’s encouraging words , otherwise I think I would have reposed by the wayside at an early stage of the ascent , yet too proud for a litter . 
Many of the party went up in litters ignominiously carried on men ’s shoulders , but I went through the whole routine on foot , as I began ; only I was inclined to halt at retardingly frequent intervals . 
The growls of the mountain every now and then warned us that a volley of rocks and stones was coming , and , behold ! 
the bunch of them shot up in a wide arc over our heads . 
The crater is a spectacle that gives the mind such occupation as it has not had before . 
Talk of the Pyramids and the Sphinx that so overpowered me at Gizeh ! 
That crater would think it a good joke to chuck them up in the air . 
“ But nothing impressed me into silence so heavily as the sight , later on , of a lava stream , lower down the mountain-side , issuing in thick ooze , and crawling slowly from out a gaping cavern . 
Liquid , deep scarlet fire was this , of the density , apparently , of oil , advancing like a fiery death to scorch and consume with slow and even flow - inexorable . 
No possibility of approaching its borders ; even where we stood the rocks began to burn our feet . 
A guide flung a log of wood on the river , and it spontaneously burst into vivid flame , shrivelled up , and was gone in a puff of smoke . 
Turning for rest and solace from the lurid spectacle , the factitious horrors of the congealed lava all around one only deepened the sense of gloom . 
Curling and curdling as they cooled , the lava streams of bygone times have hardened into the most weird shapes the imagination could conceive . 
We seemed to be on a battlefield where Titan warriors lay distorted in their death agony ; enormous mothers clasped their babies in the embrace of death , and the war-horses were monsters of pre-historic stature , petrified in the last throes . 
“ We could see far , far down on the plain the skeleton of poor little Pompeii like a minute raised plan delicately modelled in plaster . 
“ The thunders of the Bible will reverberate in my mind with more vitality since our excursion to Vesuvius . ”
