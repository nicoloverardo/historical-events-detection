He O O

He O O

he O O
thought B-MENTAL B-MENTAL

The O O

say B-COMMUNICATION B-COMMUNICATION
that O O

Of O O
course O O

the O O

sometimes O O
misquote B-COMMUNICATION B-COMMUNICATION
a O O

Who O O
has O O
not O O

whom O O
they O O

Fortunately O O
for O O

, O O
though O O

Perhaps O O
the O O
principal O O
reason O O
why O O
this O O
is B-EMOTIONSEVALUATIONS B-EMOTIONSEVALUATIONS
true I-EMOTIONSEVALUATIONS I-EMOTIONSEVALUATIONS
is B-EXISTENCECAUSATION B-EXISTENCECAUSATION
that O O

that O O
which O O

really O O

He O O
can O O
say B-COMMUNICATION B-COMMUNICATION
good O O

there O O
is B-EXISTENCECAUSATION B-EXISTENCECAUSATION
n't O O
any O O
doubt O O
of O O

but O O
that O O
he O O

is B-EXISTENCECAUSATION B-EXISTENCECAUSATION
no O O
earthly O O
use O O

Perhaps O O
it O O
is B-EXISTENCECAUSATION B-EXISTENCECAUSATION
