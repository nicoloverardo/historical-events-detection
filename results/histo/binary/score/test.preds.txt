a I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

We O O
lingered B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

as O O

brought B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

; O O
but O O
for O O
beauty O O
or O O
grace O O
there O O
was B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
no O O
reason O O
why O O
this O O

Among O O
the O O

from O O

Zelphine O O

I O O
have O O
decided B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O

never O O
acknowledge B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

be B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

not O O
nearly O O
life-size O O
, O O
and O O
for O O
that O O
reason O O
, O O
perhaps O O
, O O
its O O
beauty O O
is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
more I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
delicate I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
and I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
spiritual I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

If O O
that O O

up I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
in O O

The O O

The O O

a I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
spectacle I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
gives B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O

Turning B-EVENT_MENTION O
