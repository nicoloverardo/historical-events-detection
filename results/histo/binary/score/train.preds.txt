To O O

with O O
you O O

Our O O
welcome O O

Genoa O O

not I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
particularly I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
cheerful I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

It O O
had O O
been O O
raining B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
for O O

; O O
the O O

was B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
heavy I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
with O O
clouds O O
, O O
and O O
the O O
air O O
chilly O O
and O O
damp O O
. O O

We O O
can O O
well O O
understand B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
why O O
the O O
prudent O O

all-informing B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
Baedeker O O
advises B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

We O O
enjoyed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
coming B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
into I-EVENT_MENTION O
the O O
fine O O
harbor O O
, O O
around O O
which O O
Genoa O O
is O O
built B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
upon O O
its O O
hills O O

terraces O O
in O O
the O O

of O O
a O O

On O O
the O O
hills O O
, O O
we O O
know B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
are B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
many O O
beautiful O O

seen B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to-day O O
but O O
dimly O B-EVENT_MENTION
through O O
veils O O
of O O
mist O O
, O O
and O O
beyond O O
are B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
mountains O O
, O O
which O O
in O O
clear O O
weather O O
must O O
add B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
much O O
to O O
the O O
charm O O
of O O
this O O
old O O
fortress O O
as O O
seen B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
from O O
the O O

Zelphine O O
says B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
it O O
would O O
be B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
very I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
ungrateful I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
of O O
us O O
if O O
we O O
were B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
complain B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
of O O
cloudy O O
weather O O
, O O
as O O
the O O
skies O O
might O O
be O O
pouring B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
down I-EVENT_MENTION O
upon O O
us O O
instead O O
of O O
only O O
threatening B-EVENT_MENTION O
, O O
and O O
, O O
after O O
all O O
, O O
we O O
are O O
having B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
same O O
good O O
luck O O
that O O
we O O
had B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
in O O
Madeira O O
, O O
Granada O O
, O O
and O O
Algiers O O
in O O
coming B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

the O O
rain B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
instead O O
of O O
before O O
it B-EVENT_MENTION O
. O O

And O O
how O O
do O O
we O O
get B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
on I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
together O O
? O O

Really O O
, O O

display B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
courage O O
when O O
you O O

I O O

wrecked B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

that O O

the O O

more O O

Whether O O

however O O

Zelphine O O

what O O
follows B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

Let O O
me O O
begin B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
by O O
saying B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
the O O
temple O O
, O O
in O O
every O O
probability O O
, O O
stood B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
at O O
the O O
Punta O O

, O O
the O O
actual O O

where O O
- O O
apart O O
from O O
every O O
other O O
kind O O

- O O
you O O
may O O
pick B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
up I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

this O O

away I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
as O O

the O O

Now O O
for O O
alternative O O
suggestions O O
. O O

Strabo O O
tells B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
us O O
that O O
the O O
temple O O
was O O
placed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
on O O
the O O

" O O
on O O

nearly I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
500 I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

It O O
is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
incredible I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
no O O
vestige O O
of O O
a O O

as O O
regards O O
immunity B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

The O O

not O O

that O O
artificial O O

which O O
an O O

of O O
this O O
importance O O
would O O
necessitate B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
; O O
the O O

is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
of I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
mediaeval I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
construction I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
as O O
can O O
be O O
seen B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
by O O
its O O
supporting O O
walls O O
. O O

No O O
doubt O O
the O O
venerable O O
Christian O O
sanctuary O O
there O O
has O O
been O O
frequently O O
repaired B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
and O O
modified B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
; O O
on O O
the O O
terrace-level O O
to O O
the O O

can O O
be O O
seen B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
foundations O O
of O O
an O O
earlier O O
chapel O O
, O O
and O O
the O O

are O O

But O O
there B-EVENT_MENTION O

no I-EVENT_MENTION O

nor O O
has O O
the O O

leading B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
up I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
to I-EVENT_MENTION O
the O O
shrine O O
been O O
demarcated B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
with O O
chisel-cuts O O

the O O
ancient O O

The O O

is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
equally I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
unproductive I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
of O O
classical O O

. O O

We O O
must O O
therefore O O
conclude B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
Strabo O O
was B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
mistaken I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

And O O
why O O
not O O
? O O

His O O
accounts O O
of O O
many O O
parts O O
of O O
the O O
Roman O O
world O O
are B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
surprisingly I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
accurate I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
but O O
, O O
according O O
to O O
Professor O O
Pais O O
, O O
" O O
of O O
Italy O O
Strabo O O
seems B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
have O O
known B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
merely O O
the O O

" O O

If O O

he O O

dotted B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
with O O
purple O O

Fortunately O O
for O O
those O O

take B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
this I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
long I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

, O O
the O O

excellent I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

We O O
drove B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
slowly O O
through O O
the O O
old O O
town O O
of O O
Cava O O
, O O
with O O
its O O
narrow O O
, O O
precipitous O O
streets O O

through O O
Salerno O O
, O O
which O O
is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
upon O O
a O O
bluff O O
overlooking B-EVENT_MENTION O
the O O

, O O
and O O
commands B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a O O
noble O O
panorama O O
of O O

When O O
, O O
however O O
, O O
we O O
reached B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O

our O O
horses O O
set B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
forth I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
at O O
a O O

There O O
was O B-EVENT_MENTION
not O O

acres O O

a O O

now O O
covered B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
with O O
white O O

, O O
which O O
I O O
believe B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
is O O
used B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
chiefly O O

Even O O
this O O

not I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

Between O O

a O O

begged B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O

allow B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
them O O

crying B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
out I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
" O O
Ecco O O

" O O

The O O

stopped B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
obediently O O
, O O
and O O
stood B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
like O O
a O O

in O O
a O O
natural O O

full O O
of O O

to O O

Here O O

bearing B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

We O O

ask B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O

some O O

At O O

This O O

a I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
better I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

The O O

When O O
we O O
came B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

to-day O O

in O O

Homer O O

at O O
the O O
critical O O
moment O O

The O O

seemed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
more I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
level I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
and O O
marshy O O
as O O
we O O
drew B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

This O O
town O O
was O O
founded B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
by O O
the O O
inhabitants O O
of O O
Pæstum O O
when O O
they O O
were O O
driven B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
from O O
their O O

by O O
the O O
Saracens O O
in O O
the O O
ninth O O
century O O
. O O

To O O
our O O
surprise O O
, O O
we O O
saw B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
herds O O
of O O
buffalo O O
grazing B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
in O O
the O O
fields O O
, O O
much O O

different O O
in O O

respects O O
from O O
the O O
American O O
bison O O
. O O

Our O O
driver O O
told B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
us O O
that O O
this O O
small O O
black O O
buffalo O O
is O O
to O O
be O O
found B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
near O O
the O O
coast O O
in O O
many O O
parts O O
of O O
Italy O O
, O O
and O O
is O O
often O O
seen B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
on O O
the O O
Campagna O O
near O O
Rome O O
. O O

From O O
the O O
number O O
of O O
calves O O
in O O
some O O
of O O
the O O
fields O O
we O O
are O O
inclined B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
think B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
the O O
young O O
buffaloes O O
are O O
used B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
for O O
food B-EVENT_MENTION O
. O O

I O O
noticed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
several O O
of O O
the O O
well-grown O O
animals O O
drawing B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
carts O O
, O O
sometimes O O
harnessed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
with O O
the O O
white O O

. O O

We O O
caught B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a I-EVENT_MENTION O
glimpse I-EVENT_MENTION O
of O O
the O O
old O O

Nothing O O

more I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

The O O

a O O
kind O O
of O O
travertine O O

to O O

the O O

imparted B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a O O
creamy O O

The O O

less I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

where O O
the O O
conquering B-EVENT_MENTION O
Saracens O O

Normans O O
and O O
the O O

left B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

the O O

of O O
the O O
daily O O
life B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

of O O
the O O
Greeks O O
who O O
made B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
their O O
home O O
upon O O
these O O
shores O O
. O O

We O O
climbed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
over I-EVENT_MENTION O
the O O
ruins O O
of O O
the O O
old O O
temples O O
and O O
sat B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
upon O O
the O O
town O O
wall O O
overlooking B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
sea O O
, O O
while O O
Angela O O
made B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
fairly I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
good I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
sketch I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
of O O
the O O

. O O

Zelphine O O
and O O
I O O
bought B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
coins O O
and O O
pottery O O
from O O
children O O
who O O
, O O
being O B-EVENT_MENTION
without O O
visible O O
habitation O O
, O O
seemed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
have O O
literally O O
sprung B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
from O O
the O O
soil O O
. O O

Finally O O
our O O
vetturino O O
warned B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
us O O
that O O
we O O
had O O
better O O
set B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
forth I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
at O O
once O O
if O O
we O O
wished B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
reach B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
Cava O O
before O O
nightfall B-EVENT_MENTION O
. O O

At O O
Battipaglia O O
we O O
resumed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
our O O
former O O
horses O O
and O O
driver O O
. O O

Zelphine O O
whispered B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
something O O
to O O
me O O
about O O
his O O
face O O
being B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
rather I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
red I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

I O O
quite O O
agreed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
with O O
her O O
, O O
but O O
as O O
the O O
mention O O
of O O
the O O
fact B-EVENT_MENTION O
could O O
not O O
be B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
of I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

the I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

, O O
there O O
was B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
nothing O O
to O O
do B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
but O O
to O O
set B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
forth I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
on O O
our O O
homeward O O

despite O O
some O O
misgivings B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
upon O O
Zelphine O O

and O O
mine O O
. O O

We O O
had O O
not O O
left B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
Battipaglia O O
before O O
I O O
realized B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
our O O
gravest O O
fears B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
were O O
fulfilled B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

Our O O
driver O O
was B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
what O O
you O O
men O O
picturesquely O O
call B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
" O O
gloriously I-EVENT_MENTION O

- O O
we O O

He O O
was B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

through O O
the O O

We O O

the O O

containing B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
Mrs. O O

They O O
called B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
after O O
us O O
, O O
but O O
must O O
have O O
seen B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
we O O

They O O

did O O
not O O
grasp B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
situation B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

but O O
when O O
they O O
did B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O

written B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

Angela O O

Remembering B-EVENT_MENTION O

Zelphine O O

I O O
made B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

to O O
stop B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
our O O

Finding B-EVENT_MENTION O
that O O
our O O
remonstrances B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
excited B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
him O O
to O O
more O O
strenuous O O

Zelphine O O
tried B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O

of O O

upon O O

urging B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

to O O
make B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
his O O

telling B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
him O O
that O O
the O O

was B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
very I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

and O O
advising B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
him O O
to O O

the O O

This O O

however O O

proved B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to I-EVENT_MENTION O
be I-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
impossible I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
; O O
the O O

by O O
this O O

only O O
succeeded B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
in O O
getting B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

The O O

we O O

as O O
we O O
rattled B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
over O I-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
Calabrian O O

Fortunately O O

the O O

well-trained I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
and O O
steady O O
enough O O
to O O

Be O O

passing B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

We O O

Some O O

Mrs. O O

looking B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

expected B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

Zelphine O O

we O O
drove B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

In O O

Now O O

The O O

our O O

suddenly O O

The O O

with O O
more O O

contrition B-EVENT_MENTION O
, O O
that O O

Angela O O
, O O
first O O
of O O
all O O
, O O
with O O
eyes O O
full O O
of O O
tears O O
, O O
wondered B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
many O O
times O O
, O O
in O O

more O O

, O O
why O O

these O O
inhospitable O O

; O O
and O O
I O O
- O O
well O O
, O O
it O O
matters B-EVENT_MENTION O
little O O
what O O
I O O
said B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

Zelphine O O
surprised B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
me O O
weeping B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
over O O
my O O
travelling-hat O O
, O O
which O O
, O O
although O O
it O O
did O O
present B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a O O
rather O O
dilapidated O O
appearance B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
after O O
yesterday O O
's O O
rain B-EVENT_MENTION O
, O O
failed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
afford B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
sufficient O O
cause O O
for O O
my O O
tears O O
. O O

She O O
, O O
the O O
heroic O O
one O O
, O O
who O O
had O O
never O O
told B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
her O O
woe B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
in O O
attempting B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
console B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
me O O
broke B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
down I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
herself O O
, O O
and O O
we O O
wept B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
in O O
each O O
other O O

arms O O
, O O
which O O
had B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O

of O O

our O O
side O O

making B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
her O O
laugh B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
heartily O O
. O O

Finally O O
, O O
in O O
desperation O O
, O O
I O O
proposed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
we O O
should O O
order B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a I-EVENT_MENTION O
cab I-EVENT_MENTION O
and O O
drive B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
over O O
to O O
the O O
Hôtel O O
de O O
Londres O O
and O O
try B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
find B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
some O O
of O O
our O O
steamer O O
friends O O
who O O
expected B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
stay B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
here O O
a O O
few O O
days O O
en O O
route O O
for O O

We O O
were O O
cordially O O
welcomed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
by O O
Bertha O O
Linn O O

Mrs. O O

who O O
received B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
us O O
in O O
their O O

one O O
of O O
which O O
was O O
comfortably O O
heated B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
by O O
a O O
porcelain O O

. O O

Despite O O
their O O
more O O
favorable O O
surroundings O O
, O O
we O O
soon O O
discovered B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
our O O
two O O
countrywomen O O
were B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
as O O
down-hearted I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
as O O
ourselves O O
. O O

Bertha O O
, O O
seated B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
upon O O
a O O
trunk O O
, O O
looking B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
about O O
as O O
cheerful O O
as O O
Miss O O
Betsey O O
Trotwood O O
when O O
she O O
came B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
up I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
London O O
in O O
pursuit B-EVENT_MENTION O
of O O
her O O
scattered O O
fortune O O
, O O
expressed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
herself O O
to O O
the O O
effect O O
that O O
foreign O O
travel B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
might O O
be B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
of I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
advantage I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
educationally O I-EVENT_MENTION
and O O
enlarging B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
the O O
mind O O
, O O
but O O
for O O
her O O
part O O
she O O
preferred B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
her O O
own O O
country O O
, O O
and O O
would O O
gladly O O
take B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
next I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
steamer I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

Angela O O
heartily O O
agreed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
with O O
Bertha O O
, O O
while O O
Zelphine O O
begged B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
her O O
to O O
remember B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
enchanting O O
days O O
we O O
had O O
spent B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
in O O
Madeira O O

and O O
that O O
even O O
more O O
delightful O O
experiences B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
lay B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
before O O
us O O
, O O
assuring B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
them O O
that O O
Italy O O

; O O
in O O
the O O
midst O O
of O O
which O O
profitable O O
conversation B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
Mrs. O O
Robins O O
suggested B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
we O O
should O O
take B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

We O O

Angela O O
, O O
laughing B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a O O
cheerless O O

with O O
a O O

No O O

be B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

adapted I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
for O O
a O O
rainy O O

the O O

Our O O
first O O
impression B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
of O O
the O O
long O O
galleries O O
with O O
their O O
monuments O O
and O O
low O O
reliefs O O
, O O
many O O
of O O
them O O
decorated B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
with O O
photographs O O
of O O
the O O
dead O O

overhung B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
with O O
the O O
tasteless O O

of O O

dear O O
to O O
the O O
Continental O O

, O O
was B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
of O O
something O O
hopelessly O I-EVENT_MENTION
inartistic I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
and I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
artificial I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

Among O O
the O O
many O O
shockingly O O
realistic O O
and O O
inappropriate O O
monuments O O
we O O
found B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a O O
few O O
simple O O
and O O
beautiful O O
statues O O
and O O
low O O
reliefs O O
. O O

You O O
remember B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
how O O
many O O
of O O
the O O
monuments O O
in O O
Westminster O O
Abbey O O
are B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
in I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
bad I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
taste I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
and O O
overweighted B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
with O O
carved O O
ornaments O O
; O O
the O O
majority O O
of O O
these O O
are B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
not I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
less I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
artistic I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
but O O
one O O
has B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a I-EVENT_MENTION O
right I-EVENT_MENTION O
to O O
expect B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
more O O
beauty O O
and O O
grace O O
in O O
Italy O O
than O O
in O O
England O O
, O O
and O O
then O O
the O O
grand O O
old O O
abbey O O
lends B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a O O
certain O O
dignity O O
to O O
everything O O
within O O
its O O
walls O O
. O O

The O O
Campo O O
Santo O O
looks B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
more O O
like O O
a O O
picture-gallery O O
than O O
a O O
necropolis O O
; O O
but O O
chacun O O

This O O
is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

the O O
Genoese O O

and O O
the O O

so I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
beautiful I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

I O O
, O O
for O O
one O O

am O O
inclined B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O

It O O
did O O
not O O
impress B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

particularly O O
; O O

we O O
found B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
ourselves O O
turning B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
again O O

again O O

the O O

It O O

of O O

vibrate B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
in O O

. O O

There O O

“ O O

to O O
my O O

I O O

at O O
a O O

of O O
getting B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

where O O

In O O

Mount O O

The O O

state B-EVENT_MENTION O
of O O
activity B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

Thick O O

about O O

It O O
must O O
not O O

Within O O
the O O

to O O
watch B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O

, O O
and O O
we O O
found B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
it O O
difficult I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
turn B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
our I-EVENT_MENTION O

The O O

looks B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
terribly I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
dreary I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
; O O
the O O
dread O O

of O O

Nothing O O

There O O

The O O
sad O O

however O O
a O O
little O O
relieved B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
by O O
the O O
different O O

The O O
view O O

very I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
extensive I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

In O O
going B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

“ O O

” O O

But O O
never O O

so O O
fully O O
what O O
the O O

In O O

what O O

A O O
time O O

when O O

I O O

with O O
my O O
mind O O

eye O O
the O O
proud O O
city O O
across O O
the O O

, O O
which O O
I O O
had O O
left B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a O O
few O O
months O O
before O O
, O O
as O O
Macaulay O O
, O O
thinking B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
of O O
a O O

describes B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
it O O

a O O

a O O
traveller O O
in O O
a O O
strange O O

speaking B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a O O

which O O
is O O
not O O

formed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

sitting B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
on O O
a O O
broken B-EVENT_MENTION O

of O O

meditating B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

We O O
did O O
not O O

as O O
Murray O O

, O O
enter B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
Pompeii O O
by O O
the O O
Strada O O

, O O
but O O
through O O
the O O
Porta O O
del O O

, O O
and O O
I O O
liked B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
it O O
better O O
, O O
as O O
the O O
Strada O O
de O O
Sepolcri O O
forms B-EVENT_MENTION O
the O O
fittest O O
finale O O
of O O
the O O
town O O
. O O

I O O
have O O
heard B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
of O O
people O O
who O O
have O O
been O O
disappointed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
in O O
Pompeii O O
, O O
others O O
have O O
said B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
same O O
of O O
the O O
Acropolis O O
. O O

I O O
can O O
not O O
understand B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
such O O
people O O
. O O

They O O
must O O
be O B-EVENT_MENTION
more O O
dead B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
than O O
the O O
very O O

there O O
, O O
for O O
they O O
spoke B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
me O O
, O O
and O O
what O O
they O O
said B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
moved B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
me O O
deeply I-EVENT_MENTION O
. O O

When O O
I O O
first O O
entered B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
city O O
of O O
the O O
dead O O
, O O
I O O
felt B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
strange I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
and I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
bewildered I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
like O O
in O O
a O O
dream B-EVENT_MENTION O
. O O

Surely O O
“ O O
reality O O
is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
stranger I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
than O O
fiction O O
. O O
” O O

What O O
can O O
be B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
more I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
strange I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
than O O
that O O
the O O
sun O O
should O O
shine B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
again O O
into O O
the O O

and O O
light B-EVENT_MENTION O
up I-EVENT_MENTION O
the O O
painted O O

mosaic O O
pavement O O
of O O
Pompeii O O
. O O

And O O
yet O O
so O O
it O O
is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

That O O
very O O
old O O
Pompeii O O
, O O
that O O
lay B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
for O O
nearly O O
eighteen O O
centuries O O
buried B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
is O O
risen B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
again O O
. O O

We O O
walk B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
through O O
its O O
streets O O
, O O
and O O
tread B-EVENT_MENTION O
the O O
very O O
stones O O
worn O B-EVENT_MENTION
out O I-EVENT_MENTION
by O O
the O O
footsteps O O
of O O
Roman O O
citizens O O
, O O
and O O
by O O
the O O
wheels O O
of O O
their O O
chariots O O
. O O

We O O
see B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
their O O
houses O O
, O O
their O O
temples O O
, O O
their O O
judgment O O

, O O
their O O

the O O

In O O
walking B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
into O O
their O O
houses O O
we O O
seem B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
become B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
strangely I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
familiar I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
with O O
their O O
former O O
inhabitants O O
; O O
we O O
see B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
everywhere O O
traces O O
of O O
their O O
being B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
of O O
their O O
virtues O O

of O O
their O O

I O O

by O O
night O O
the O O
spirits O O
of O O
the O O
departed O O
haunt B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O

but O O
it O O
was B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
by O O
broad O O
cheerful O O
daylight O O
that O O
I O O
visited B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
it O O
, O O
and O O
therefore O O
it O O
seemed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
inhabited I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
only O O
by O O
pretty O O
little O O

, O O
which O O
I O O
saw B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
flitting B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
about O O
on O O
every O O
wall O O
, O O
and O O
between O O

1st O O

As O O
we O O
first O O
beheld B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
Assisi O O
from O O
the O O
railroad O O
station O O
at O O
sunset O O
, O O
the O O
delicate O O
mauve O O
pink O O
of O O
her O O
towers O O
and O O
walls O O
glowed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
with O O
a O O
more O O
rosy O O
hue O O
and O O
it O O
seemed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
as O O
if O O
the O O
old O O
town O O
for O O
a O O
brief O O
moment O O
must O O
have O O
worn B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
something O O
of O O
the O O
grace O O
of O O
her O O
long-vanished O O
youth O O
. O O

On O O
one O O
side O O
of O O
the O O
station O O
is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
little O O
village O O
of O O
the O O
plain O O
, O O
Santa O O
Maria O O
degli O O
Angeli O O

with O O
the O O
church O O
from O O
which O O
it O O
takes B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
its O I-EVENT_MENTION
name I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
so O O
christened B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
by O O
St. O O

in O O
memory O O
of O O
the O O
angelic O O
visions B-EVENT_MENTION O

On O O
the O O
other O O
side O O
of O O
the O O
road O O
, O O
across O O
a O O
sweep O O
of O O
green O O
meadows O O
, O O
is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
town O O

built B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
upon O O
terraces O O
half-way O O
up O O
the O O

Mount O O

to O O
a O O
height O O
of O O
over O O
three O O
thousand O O
feet O O
above O O
the O O

. O O

The O O
crowning O O
glory O O
of O O
Assisi O O
is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
great I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
basilica I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
of O O
San O O
Francesco O O
, O O
with O O
its O O
remarkable O O
substructure O O
- O O
a O O
vast O O
colonnaded O O
monastery O O
standing B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
guard I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
over O O
the O O
happy O O
valley O O
beneath O O
. O O

Our O O
approach B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
was O O
by O O
winding B-EVENT_MENTION O
roads O O
bordered B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
by O O
hedges O O
, O O
with O O
fields O O
beyond O O
green O O
as O O
England O O
and O O
bright O O
as O O
Italy O O
alone O O
, O O
all O O
abloom O O
to-day O O
with O O

Up O O
and O O
up O O
the O O
shining B-EVENT_MENTION O
way O O
climbed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
shabby O O
vettura O O
with O O
its O O
lean O O
horse O O
, O O
until O O
we O O
seemed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
be O O
getting B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
near I-EVENT_MENTION O
the O O
blue O O
of O O
the O O

, O O
so O O
close O O
does O O
the O O
arch O O
of O O
heaven O O
lean B-EVENT_MENTION O
to O O
these O O
hill O O
towns O O
of O O
Italy O O
. O O

We O O
all O O
felt B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
we O O
had O O
left B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
world O O
of O O
to-day O O
far O O
behind O O
us O O
when O O
we O O
drove B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
through O O
the O O
ancient O O
Porta O O
San O O

, O O
so O O
entirely O O
does O O
Assisi O O
belong B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
the O O
past O O
. O O

Here O O
where O O
everything O O
is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
ancient I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
one O O
ceases B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
make B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
comparisons I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
and O O
it O O
seemed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
no I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
more I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
remarkable I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
to O O

a O O

standing B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
beside O O
twelfth-century O O

that O O

hearing B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O

You O O
really O O

an O O
ordinary O O

When O O

I O O
had B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
more O O
than O O
an O O

on O O
my O O
hands O O
, O O
so O O
I O O
lingered B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
for O O
some O O
time O O
before O O
the O O
tall O O
monument O O
in O O
the O O
Square O O
of O O

This O O

has B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
much O O
of O O
the O O

and O O
strength O O
of O O
the O O
Nelson O O

on O O
Trafalgar O O
Square O O
, O O
having B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
like O O
it O O

The O O

After O O
gazing B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
long O O
at O O
the O O
beautiful O O

, O O
I O O
strolled B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
down O O
the O O
Strada O O

to O O
the O O
esplanade O O
with O O
the O O
statues O O

, O O
a O O
charming O O
place O O
to O O

on O O
a O O
cool O O
afternoon O O
. O O

You O O
know B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
my O O
fancy O O
for O O
wandering B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
alone O O
through O O
strange O O
streets O O
and O O
byways O O
. O O

On O O
and O O
on O O
I O O
sauntered B-EVENT_MENTION O
, O O
thinking B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
I O O
might O O
have B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
time I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
walk B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
as O O
far O O
as O O

Aquarium O O
before O O
keeping B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
my O O
tryst O O
at O O
the O O
coral O O

, O O
and O O
not O O
fully O O
realizing B-EVENT_MENTION O
how O O
deserted B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
place O O
was I-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
until O O
I O O
heard B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a O O
penetrating O O
voice O O
quite O O
close O O
to O O
me O O
speaking B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
rapid O O
and O O
almost O O
unintelligible O O
French O O
, O O
accompanied B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
by O O
the O O
cracking B-EVENT_MENTION O
of O O
a O O
whip O O
. O O
" O O

A O O
cabman O O
- O O
I O O
'll O O
pay B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
no I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
attention I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
him O O
, O O
" O O
I O O
said B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
myself O O
; O O
" O O
he O O
'll O O
be O O
discouraged B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
after O O
a O O
while O O
and O O
leave B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
me O O
. O O
" O O

I O O
soon O O
found B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
I O O
had O O
reckoned B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
without O O
my O O
host O O
: O O
that O O
vociferous O O
, O O
whip-cracking B-EVENT_MENTION O
Jehu O O
followed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
me O O
, O O
dogged B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
my O O
steps O O
, O O
offered B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
me O O
his O O
cab O O
at O O
absurdly O O
low O O
rates O O
, O O
and O O
finally O O
cornered B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
me O O
in O O
a O O
recess O O
of O O
one O O
of O O
the O O
large O O
public O O
buildings O O
. O O

I O O
looked B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
around I-EVENT_MENTION O
; O O
there O O
was B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
not O O
a O O
person O O
in O O
sight B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
help B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
me O O
, O O
only O O
a O O
few O O
beggars O O
on O O
the O O
steps O O
, O O
who O O
would O O
naturally O O
make B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
common O I-EVENT_MENTION
cause I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
with O O
the O O
cabman O O
. O O

You O O
will O O
laugh B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
at O O
me O O
, O O
I O O
am B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
sure I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
but O O
so O O
terrified B-EVENT_MENTION O
was I-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
I O I-EVENT_MENTION
by O O
the O O
creature O O
's O O
language O O
and O O
gestures B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
and O O
whip-cracking B-EVENT_MENTION O
that O O
I O O
abjectly O O
stepped B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
into I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
his O O
cab O O
, O O
telling B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
him O O
to O O
drive B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
me O O
for O O
an O O
hour O O
and O O
set B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
me O O
down I-EVENT_MENTION O
at O O
the O O
well-known O O
coral O O
shop O O
on O O
the O O
Chiaia O O
at O O
five O O
o'clock O O
, O O
showing B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
him O O
the O O
time O O
on O O
my O O
watch-face O O
. O O

Was B-EVENT_MENTION O
I O O
not O O
just O O
a O O
bit O O
like I-EVENT_MENTION O
the I-EVENT_MENTION O
woman I-EVENT_MENTION O
who O O
married B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

persistent O O
suitor O O
in O O

to O O

rid I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
of I-EVENT_MENTION O
him O O

Her O O
troubles B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
probably O O
began B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
then O O
and O O
there O O
; O O
mine O O
certainly O O
did B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

My O O
cocher O O
, O O
with O O
an O O
irritating B-EVENT_MENTION O
expression O O
of O O
triumph B-EVENT_MENTION O
on O O
his O O
face O O
, O O
set B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
forth I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
upon O O
a O O
tour B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
of O O
sight-seeing B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
which O O
threatened B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
be B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
of I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
long I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
duration I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

We O O
passed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
from O O
street O O
to O O
street O O
, O O
from O O
building O O
to O O
building O O
, O O
until O O
to O O
my O O
dismay O O
I O O
found B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
he O O
was O O
driving B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
toward O O
the O O
upper O O
town O O
. O O

I O O
protested B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
knowing B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
there O O
would O O
not O O
be B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

by O O
five O O
o'clock O O

Would O O
I O O
like B-EVENT_MENTION O
to O O
see B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
San O O
Martino O O
? O O

No O O
, O O
I O O
answered B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
with O O
decision O O
, O O
I O O
had O O
already O O
been B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O

I O O
wished B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

the O O
Chiaia O O

Then O O
- O O
for O O
astuteness O O
commend B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
me O O
to O O
a O O
Neapolitan O O
vetturino O O
- O O
that O O
irritating B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
creature O O
became B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
suddenly I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
deaf I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
dumb O O
, O O
and O O
blind O O
, O O
while O O

on O O
up O O

Fortunately O O
, O O
the O O

, O O
and O O
as O O
we O O
reached B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

I O O
saw B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

that O O

I O O
began B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
recognize B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

listened B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

the O O

slackened B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

Yes O O

He O O

Everyone O O

The O O

From O O
Rome O O
I O O
went B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
Pompeii O O
, O O
stopping B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
long O O
enough O O
at O O
Naples O O
, O O
however O O
, O O
to O O
learn B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
the O O
impudence O O
of O O
the O O
pestiferous O O
porters O O
is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
quite I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
unendurable I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

Italy O O
throughout O O
is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
much I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
infested I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
with O O
porters O O
, O O
but O O
in O O
the O O
southern O O
section O O
of O O
the O O
peninsula O O
they O O
are B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
regular I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
pest I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
which O O
at O O
times O O
becomes B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
epidemic I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

During O O
the O O
traveling B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
season O O
it O O
seems B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
as O O
if O O
everybody O O
was B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
porter I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

Sometimes O O
they O O
will O O
surround B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
traveler O O
and O O
assail B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
him O O
on O O
every O O
side O O
, O O
asking B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
him O O
to O O
let B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
them O O
carry B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
his O O

Sometimes O O
I O O
found B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
them O O
to O O
be B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
of I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
great I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
service I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
in O O
finding B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
hotels O O
for O O
me O O
, O O
but O O
at O O
other O O
times O O
I O O
was O O
much O O
inconvenienced B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
by O O
their O O
attacks B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

I O O
think B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
it O O
was B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
at O O
Naples O O
, O O
where O O
a O O
dozen O O
or O O
more O O
of O O
them O O
yelled B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
at O O
me O O
all O O
at O O
the O O
same O O
time O O
, O O
each O O
desirous O O
of O O
carrying B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
my O O
satchel O O
. O O

As O O
none O O
of O O
them O O
could O O
speak B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
in O O
a O O
language O O
that O O
I O O
understood B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
I O O
declined B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
let B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
any O O
one O O
have B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
it O O
. O O

Each O O
one O O
evinced B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
his O O
earnestness O O
by O O
taking B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
hold I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
of O O
my O O
baggage O O
while O O
asking B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
for O O
it O O
. O O

After O O
taking B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
turns I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
at O O
their O O
chances O O
in O O
this O O
way O O
for O O
a O O
while O O
, O O
at O O
the O O

crowding B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
path O O
in O O

of O O
me O O
so O O
that O O
I O O
could O O
not O O
proceed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
one O O
of O O
them O O
in O O
his O O
greediness O O
almost O O
tore B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
my O O
satchel O O
out I-EVENT_MENTION O
of O O
my O O
hands O O
, O O
I O O
responded B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
his O O
supplication B-EVENT_MENTION O
with O O
such O O
a O O
tremendous O O
no O O
, O O
that O O
the O O
next O O
fellow O O
assumed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a O O
stooping O O
posture O O
and O O
asked B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
me O O
in O O
a O O
whisper O O
! O O

These O O
people O O
deserve B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
our O O
pity O O
rather O O
than O O
censure O O

Many O O
of O O

sometimes O O
in O O
a O O

But O O

can O O
form B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
an I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

of O O
the O O

I O O

Such O O
a O O

that O O

he O O

it O O
was B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
all I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
right I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

He O O
allowed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
his O O

where O O

it O O

where O O
he O O

show B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

off I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
and O O
he O O
thought B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
he O O
was O O
doing B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
here O O
pretty O O
well O O
. O O

The O O
reporters O O
say B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
he O O
said B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
these O O
things O O
. O O

Of O O
course O O
, O O
the O O

sometimes O O
misquote B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

Who O O
has O O
not O O
known B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

though O O

Perhaps O O
the O O
principal O O
reason O O
why O O
this O O
is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
true I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
nobody O O

that O O

He O O

there O O
is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

any O O
doubt O O
of O O
that O O

that O O
he O O
has B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
no O O
earthly O O
use O O
of O O
pretending B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

Perhaps O O
it O O
is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
because O O
of O O
this O O
very O O
lack B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
the O O

The B-EVENT_MENTION O

The O O

A O O

out I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
with O O

in O O
the O O

The O O

wreak B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

with O O
a O O

The O O
