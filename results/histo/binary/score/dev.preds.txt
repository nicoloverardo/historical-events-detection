We O O

spent B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
day O O
in O O
the O O
streets O O
and O O
houses O O
of O O
Pompeii O O
, O O
living B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
over O O
again O O
in O O

Lord O O

His O O
descriptions O O
are B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
still I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
marvellously I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
accurate I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
although O O
so O O
much O O
has O O
been O O
unearthed B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
since O O
he O O
wrote B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
" O O
The O O

of O O

that O O
the O O
ruins O O
as O O
they O O
stand B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to-day O O
are B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
much I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
more I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
extensive I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
than O O
those O O

by O O

The O O
house O O

apparently O O
as O O
perfect O O
as O O
in O O
the O O
days O O
when O O
Glaucus O O
thus O O
whimsically O O
greeted B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
his O O

to O O

Lord O O
Lytton O O
was B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
in O O
Naples O O
during O O
the O O
winter O O
of O O
the O O
most O O
important O O
excavations B-EVENT_MENTION O
at O O
Pompeii O O
, O O
and O O
his O O
romance O O
doubtless O O
took B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
form I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
and O O
shape O O
as O O
he O O
walked B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
through I-EVENT_MENTION O
these O O
deserted B-EVENT_MENTION O
streets O O
, O O
where O O
the O O
ruts O O
made B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
by O O
the O O
chariot-wheels O O
of O O
the O O
two O O
rivals O O
, O O
Glaucus O O
and O O
Arbaces O O
, O O
are O O
still O O
to O O
be O O
seen B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

The O O
houses O O
, O O
as O O
he O O
tells B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
us O O
, O O
still O O
undespoiled O O
of O O
their O O
exquisite O O
decorations O O
and O O
rich O O
furniture O O
, O O
were B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
much O I-EVENT_MENTION
as O O
their O O
unfortunate O O
owners O O
left B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
them O O
. O O

Even O O
now O O
, O O
despite O O
the O O
fact B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
many O O
of O O
the O O
beautiful O O

, O O

, O O

, O O
and O O
other O O
ornaments O O
have O O
been O O
taken B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
the O O
Naples O O
Museum O O
, O O
much O O
is O B-EVENT_MENTION
still O I-EVENT_MENTION
left B-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
of O O
the O O
interior O O
of O O
the O O
houses O O
, O O
enough O O
to O O
give B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
one O O
a I-EVENT_MENTION O
very I-EVENT_MENTION O
good I-EVENT_MENTION O
idea I-EVENT_MENTION O
of O O
how O O
these O O
luxurious O O
Pompeians O O
lived B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

The O O
lower O O
floors O O
of O O
some O O
of O O
these O O
houses O O
, O O
as O O
that O O
of O O
the O O
Vettii O O
and O O
the O O
Faun O O
, O O
are B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
complete I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
with O O
their O O
vestibule O O
, O O
dining-room O O
, O O
parlor O O
, O O
bedrooms O O
, O O
and O O
kitchen O O
. O O

These O O
rooms O O
are B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
all O I-EVENT_MENTION
rather I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
small I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
according O O
to O O
our O O
ideas O O
, O O
as O O
the O O
wise O O
Pompeians O O
lived B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
out O I-EVENT_MENTION
of O O
doors O O
, O O
spending B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
their O O
days O O
in O O
the O O
large O O
central O O
court O O
of O O
their O O
houses O O
or O O
in O O
the O O
gardens O O
. O O

Of O O
the O O
gardens O O
we O O
saw B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
most O O
perfect O O
examples O O
in O O
the O O
house O O
of O O
the O O
Vettii O O
. O O

The O O
restoration B-EVENT_MENTION O
seems B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
have O O
been O O
made B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
most O O
carefully O B-EVENT_MENTION
here O O
as O O
elsewhere O O
; O O
even O O
the O O
graceful O O
bronze O O
statuettes O O
are O B-EVENT_MENTION
not O I-EVENT_MENTION
wanting B-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
as O O
excellent O O
replicas O O
have O O
been O O
put B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
in I-EVENT_MENTION O
the I-EVENT_MENTION O
places I-EVENT_MENTION O
of O O
the O O
originals O O
, O O
which O O
are B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
in O O
the O O
Naples O O
Museum O O
. O O

Nothing O O
brings B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
reality B-EVENT_MENTION O
of O O
that O O
old O O
life B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
before O O
us O O
more O O
forcibly O B-EVENT_MENTION
than O O
to O O
walk B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
along I-EVENT_MENTION O
the O O
streets O O
, O O
where O O
the O O
bakeries O O
and O O
the O O
wine O O
and O O
oil O O
shops O O
are O B-EVENT_MENTION
still O O
to O O
be O O
found B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

In O O
the O O
latter O O
are B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
many O O
great O O
jars O O
, O O
which O O
are B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
as O O
Zelphine O O
says B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
not I-EVENT_MENTION O
unlike I-EVENT_MENTION O
those O O
in O O
which O O
Morgiana O O
entrapped B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
her O O
Forty O O
Thieves O O
. O O

Turning B-EVENT_MENTION O
a I-EVENT_MENTION O
corner I-EVENT_MENTION O
, O O
we O O
were O B-EVENT_MENTION
startled B-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
by O O
seeing B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a O O
roughly O O
drawn O O
sketch B-EVENT_MENTION O
upon O O
a O O
wall O O
, O O
such O O
as O O
any O O
street O O
gamin O O
of O O
to-day O O
might O O
draw B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
upon O O
a O O
tempting O O
blank O O
surface O O
. O O

Further O O
along O O
the O O
same O O
street O O
we O O
beheld B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a O O
still O O
stronger O O
evidence O O
that O O
the O O
life B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
of O O
Pompeii O O
was B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
not I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
altogether I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
different I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
from O O
that O O
of O O
our O O
own O O
time O O
. O O

Something O O
corresponding O O
to O O
a O O
modern O O
poster O O
announced B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
in O O
red O O
letters O O
the O O
name O O
of O O
a O O
favorite O O
candidate O O
for O O
the O O
next O O
municipal O O
election B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

We O O
lingered B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
long O O
in O O
the O O
vast O O
amphitheatre O O
, O O
in O O
which O O
the O O
Pompeians O O
were O O
wont O B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
take B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
their I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
pleasure I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
protected B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
in O O
sunny O O
weather O O
by O O
an O O
awning O O
, O O
whose O O
usefulness O O
we O O
could O O
appreciate B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to-day O O
, O O
as O O
the O O
sun O O
of O O
March O O
is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
intensely I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
hot I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
in O O
this O O
region O O
. O O

The O O
barracks O O
for O O
the O O
gladiators O O
, O O
near O O
the O O
theatre O O
, O O
are B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
not I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
unlike I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
the O I-EVENT_MENTION
casemates O I-EVENT_MENTION
for O O
soldiers O O
in O O
a O O
fort O O
, O O
and O O
are B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
quite I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION

Bulwer O O

just O O
read B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
me O O
Pansa O O

lament O B-EVENT_MENTION
over O O
what O O
he O O
considered B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
an O O
infamous O O
law O O
, O O
that O O
forbade B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a O O

Having O O
seen B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
houses O O
of O O
Glaucus O O
and O O
Pansa O O
, O O
one O O
can O O
more O O
readily O O
understand B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
point O O
of O O

of O O
these O O
luxurious O O
, O O
pleasure-loving B-EVENT_MENTION O
ancients O O
, O O
who O O
were B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
probably I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
not I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
more I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
cruel I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
than O O
many O O
of O O
their O O
contemporaries O O
. O O

We O O
left B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
Pompeii O O
late O O
this O O
afternoon O O
and O O
came B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
La O O
Cava O O
, O O
a O O
pretty O O
town O O
in O O
the O O
mountains O O
, O O
where O O
we O O
are O O
stopping B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
on O O
our O O
way O O
to O O
PÃ¦stum O O
. O O

Zelphine O O
has O O
just O O
been O O
talking B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
the O O
padrone O O
, O O
who O O
speaks B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
excellent O O
English O O
, O O
about O O
the O O
excursion B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to-morrow O O
. O O

Our O O
tickets O O
, O O

we O O
bought B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
of O O
the O O

at O O
the O O
Hotel O O

entitle B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
us O O
to O O
a O O
drive B-EVENT_MENTION O
or O O
a O O
railway B-EVENT_MENTION O
journey I-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

The O O
padrone O O
strongly O O
advises B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
former B-EVENT_MENTION O
. O O

He O O
says B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
the O O
trains O O
are B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
so I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
slow I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
and O O
the O O
waits B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
so I-EVENT_MENTION O
long I-EVENT_MENTION O
that O O
we O O
make B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
almost O O
as O O
good O O
time O O
by O O
driving B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
and O O
then O O
it O O
is B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
much I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
more I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
interesting I-EVENT_MENTION I-EVENT_MENTION
. O O

The O O
drive B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
is O B-EVENT_MENTION
between O O
forty O O
and O O
fifty O O
miles O O
, O O
but O O
by O O
starting B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
at O O
eight O O
o'clock O O
in O O
the O O
morning O O
, O O
and O O
changing B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
horses O O
at O O
Battipaglia O O
, O O
we O O
shall O O
have B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
two O O
hours O O
at O O
PÃ¦stum O O

get B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION

Another O O
party O O
of O O
American O O
travellers O O

of O O
the O O
inconvenient O O
number O O
of O O
five O O
, O O
go B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
by O O
coach O O
to-morrow O O
. O O

The O O
padrone O O
asks B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
us O O
, O O
in O O
case O O
we O O
decide B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
drive B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
whether O O
we O O
will O O
give B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
a O O
seat O O
in O O
our O O
carriage O O
to O O
the O O
odd O O
number O O
. O O

Having O O
concluded B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
to O O
drive B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
, O O
we O O
are O O
hoping B-EVENT_MENTION B-EVENT_MENTION
that O O
the O O
fifth O O

you O O
