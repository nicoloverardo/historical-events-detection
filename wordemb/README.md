# How to acquire word embeddings
The links below point to the official downloads:
1. Glove (Common Crawl - 840B tokens, 2.2M vocab, cased, 300d vectors, 2.03 GB download): [glove.840B.300d.zip](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip)
2. HistoGlove (a set of word embeddings pre-trained on a part of the [COHA corpus](https://corpus.byu.edu/coha/) made of texts published between 1860 and 1939 for a total of more than 198 million tokens): [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HVIZpCmei90tE2hMWIyH-b7_hhHUKnmb)

For the historical word embeddings (2.), you will need to download the HistoGlove.txt.zip file and unzip it.
However, we already provide a filtered and compressed embeddings file for both Glove and HistoGlove. These two `.npz` files are located in the same folder of the txt dataset files.
